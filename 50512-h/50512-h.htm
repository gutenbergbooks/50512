<h2>MR. WAYT’S WIFE’S SISTER.</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> breezy May day, such a little while ago
that it is hardly safe to name the year, a New
Jersey ferry “car-boat” was so far behind her time
that the 12.30 train for Fairhill left without waiting
for her.</p>

<p>Ignorant, or incredulous of the untoward happening,
the passengers rushed for and through
the station to find egress discouraged by the impassive
official whose stentorian tones were roaring
through the building the name and stopping
places of the next train. Among the foremost in
the pell-mell run was a hazel-eyed young man
with a gripsack in his hand, and the olive bronze
of a sea voyage upon a very good-looking face.
He was always persuaded that he could have
eluded the great-voiced doorkeeper and boarded
the last platform of the moving cars, had he not
run afoul of a wheeled chair midway between the
seats and inconveniently set radiators in the waiting
room, and narrowly escaped a “header.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
did not actually fall; neither did he overset the
vehicle. Avoiding both calamities by vaulting
the dashboard and front wheels, he yet dropped
his hat and valise in different directions, and
brought up at an obtuse angle by catching at
one of the marble-topped radiators. The first use
he made of his hat, which was picked up by a
smiling bystander, was to lift it to a woman who
was propelling what he had mistaken for a baby’s
perambulator.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I am sure!” he said, in
manly fashion. “I hope the”—he was about to
say “baby,” but changed the phraseology just in
time—“that nobody was hurt!”</p>

<p>A glimpse of the occupant of the chair had
showed him a wan face too old for a child’s, too
small for that of a grown person. Before the
woman addressed could reply, elfish accents,
husky and precise, said, “Not at all—thank
you!” and there was a cackle of shrill, feeble
laughter.</p>

<p>The young fellow had lost the train that should
have returned him in forty minutes to the family
he had not seen in six months; he was just off
shipboard, and felt the need of a bath and toilet
upon steady ground, with plenty of elbow room.
He had come near having a bad fall, and had not
missed making a ludicrous spectacle of himself
for the entertainment of a gaping crowd. But he
laughed in a jolly, gentlemanly way, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
raising his hat passed on without a second glance
at the mute personage who had pushed the
wagon directly across his track.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the disappointed wayfarers he
walked quite up to the outlet of the station, and
peered anxiously through at the empty rails, still
vibrating from the wheels of the vanishing train,
yet he neither frowned nor swore. He did not
even ask: “When does the next train go to Fairhill?”
The time-table in his pocket and that
upon the wall, set at “2 <small>P. M.</small>,” told him all and
more than he wanted to know. The excitement
and suspense over, his inner man became importunate.
He had had an early breakfast on the
<i>City of Rome</i>, and was far hungrier now than
then. Doubling upon his tracks, he repaired to
the restaurant in the same building with the
vast waiting room and offices. The place was
clean, and full of odors that, for a wonder, were
fresh and savory, instead of hanging on the air
and clinging to the walls like a viewless “In
Memoriam” of an innumerable caravan of dead-and-gone
feasts. The <i>menu</i> was promising to an
unsated appetite, and having given his order to
a waiter the even-tempered customer sat back in
his chair and surveyed the scene with the air of
one whose mind was, as the hymnist aptly puts
it, “at leisure from itself.”</p>

<p>This lack of self-consciousness underlay much
that made March Gilchrist popular in his set.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
He was a clever artist, and wrought hard and
well at his profession, although he had a rich
father. His position in society was assured, his
physique fine, and education excellent—advantages
fully appreciated by most of the men, and
all the women he knew. If he recognized their
value he was an adroit dissembler. Simple and
frank in manner, he met his world with outstretched
hand. When the hand was not taken
he laughed in good-humored astonishment, went
about his business, and forgot the churl. His
schoolmates used to say that it did not pay to
quarrel with him; his parents, that he and his
sister May should exchange names. That his
amiability was not the result of a phlegmatic
temperament was apparent in the quick brightness
of the eyes that roved about the dining
room, leaving out nothing—from the lunch
counter in the adjoining room, set with long
ranks of salvers with globular glass covers that
gave the array the expression of a chemist’s
laboratory, to the whirligig fans that revolved
just below the ceiling with the dual mission of
cooling the atmosphere and chasing away flies.
Our returned traveler seemed to find these
harbingers of summer weather and summer pests
amusing. He was watching them when a voice
behind him accosted a hurrying waiter.</p>

<p>“There is a young girl over there who cannot
walk. Will you lift her out of her chair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
bring her in? It is just at the door, and she is
very light.”</p>

<p>“Busy now, miss! Better ask somebody
else!” pushing past.</p>

<p>The baffled applicant stood in the middle of
the floor, irresolute, seeming the more solitary
and helpless because young and a woman. Thus
much, and not that she was comely and a lady,
March saw before he sprang to his feet and faced
her respectfully.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon! but can I be of use? It will
give me pleasure if you will allow me.” Catching
sight in the doorway of the one in whose behalf
she had spoken, an arch smile—respectful still—lighted
up his honest countenance. “If you will
let me make amends for my awkwardness of a
while ago!”</p>

<p>He was a society man, and might have been
aware how unconventional was the offer. He
palliated the solecism, in describing the incident at
home, by saying that he saw in every elderly
woman his mother, in a young one, his only
sister.</p>

<p>“Thank you! if you will be so kind”—accepting
the proposal as simply as it had been made. “I
could bring her in myself, but she does not like
to have me do it here.”</p>

<p>“I should think not, indeed! One of the best
uses to which a man’s muscles can be put is to
help the weak,” rejoined March heartily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>A gleam crossed the unchildish visage of the
cripple when he stooped to lift her. She recognized
him, but offered no verbal remark then, or
when he deposited the light burden in the chair
set for her by a waiter more humane, or less
driven than his testy comrade.</p>

<p>“You are very good, and we are much obliged
to you,” the guardian said, with a little bow of
acknowledgment which he took as dismissal also,
withdrawing to his own place.</p>

<p>“Set the table for seven, please,” he heard her
continue to the waiter, businesslike and quiet,
“and reserve another seat at that table”—designating
one remote from the larger—“for a gentleman
who will come in by and by. There is a
man, too, for whom I wish to order luncheon at
the counter in that room. He can get a good
meal and be comfortable there, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“A traveling party of nine!” thought March,
apparently intent upon the depths of his soup
tureen. “With this girl as courier. Yet she
mentioned two men!”</p>

<p>The family filed in while he speculated. Twin
boys of twelve or thirteen, dressed exactly alike
in gray jackets and knickerbockers, except that
the red-haired one wore a blue necktie and the
brown-haired a scarlet; a pretty, blue-eyed girl of
eight, and a toddler of two, led by a sweet-faced
mother, with fair hair and faintly tinted complexion,
of the china shepherdess school. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
“courier,” assisted by the waiter, seated them all
without bustle, before addressing an individual
who had followed at a respectful distance and
now hung aloof, chewing the brim of a brand-new
straw hat.</p>

<p>“Homer!” said the young lady gently and distinctly,
as she might direct a child, “you will get
your dinner in the next room. Come!”</p>

<p>By shifting his position slightly, March could
see her point the man to a stool and give orders
for his refreshment. He was undersized, lean,
and sandy haired, small of feature and loutish in
carriage. His eyes had red rims, and blinked
incessantly, as if excessively weak or purblind.
When he began operations upon coffee and sandwiches,
he gobbled voraciously, gnawing off
mouthfuls like a greedy dog. His clothes were so
distressingly ready-made, and accentuated his uncouthness
so unmercifully, as to leave no doubt
that the wearing of coat and vest was a novelty
and an equivocal boon.</p>

<p>“An odd fish!” commented March mentally.
“Why should a civilized family haul him after
them like a badly made kite tail? And they are
not vulgarians, either!”</p>

<p>His eyes strayed discreetly back to the table
set for seven. The mistress of ceremonies sat at
the head, and was studying the printed <i>menu</i>. It
lay flat on the cloth that the crippled girl at her
right might read it with her. Their heads were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
close together, and the gravity upon the countenance
of the elder was reflected by the shrewd
elfin face. Presently they began to whisper, the
bare, thin finger of the younger of the two tracing
the lines to the extreme right of the <i>carte</i>.
It was plainly a question of comparative expense,
March perceived with a pang of his kind heart.
For he had been a boy himself, and the children
were hungry.</p>

<p>“Hurry up—won’t you, Hetty,” called the redheaded
twin impatiently. “Give us the first
thing you come to so long as it isn’t corned beef,
pork and beans, or rice pudding. I’m <i>starved!</i>”</p>

<p>“Me, too!” echoed his fellow.</p>

<p>“You needn’t make mincemeat of your English
on that account!” piped the crippled sister tartly.
“It is no little matter to order just the right
things for such a host. Mamma, you must have
a cup of tea, I suppose?”</p>

<p>The young lady interposed, writing while she
talked:</p>

<p>“Of course! And all of us will be the better
for some good, hot soup. This is luncheon, not
dinner, recollect. We only need something to
stay our appetites until six o’clock,” she added,
putting the paper in the waiter’s hand.</p>

<p>She did not look like one who did things for
effect, yet there was meaning in her manner of
saying it. If she was obliged to cut her coat
according to her cloth, she would just now make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the scantiness of the pattern seem a matter of
choice and carry out the seaming gallantly.</p>

<p>“How much further have we to go?” queried
eight-year-old, somewhat ruefully.</p>

<p>Six o’clock was to her apprehension a long time
ahead.</p>

<p>“We are within half an hour of home. We
might have been there by now, but we thought it
better to wait over a train to rest and get rid of
the dust we brought off the cars.”</p>

<p>“And to let <i>him</i> get shaved and barbered and
prinked up generally!” shrilled the cripple malevolently.</p>

<p>“Hester!” The mother’s voice was heard for
the first time.</p>

<p>“Well, mamma?”</p>

<p>“That is not respectful, my love. You are
tired, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>The shrewd face jerked fretfully, and the lips
were opened for a retort, checked by a gloved
hand laid upon the forward child’s. There was
only a murmur, accompanied by a pettish shrug.</p>

<p>March was ashamed of the impulse that made
him steal a look at the tray bearing the result of
the whispered consultation. Three tureens, each
containing two generous portions of excellent
English gravy soup with barley in it, a pot of
tea, bread and milk for the baby and plenty of
bread and butter were duly deposited upon the
board.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll take the rest of your order now,” said the
waiter, civilly suggestive.</p>

<p>“This is all. Thank you!” in a matter-of-course
tone that was not resentfully positive.</p>

<p>The “courier” understood herself, and having
taken ground, how to hold it. This was luncheon.
March caught himself speculating as to the
dinner bill of fare.</p>

<p>The spokeswoman may have been two-and-twenty.
She was slightly above the middle
height of healthy womanhood, had gray, serious
eyes, with brown shadows in them when the lids
drooped; well-formed lips that curled roguishly
at the corners in smiling; a straight nose with
mobile nostrils, and a firm chin. There was character
in plenty in the face. Such free air and
sunshine as falls into most girls’ lives might have
made it beautiful. The pose of her head, the
habitual gravity of eyes and mouth, the very carriage
of the shoulders and her gait testified to the
untimely sense of responsibility borne by this
one. She was slight and straight; her gown of
fawn-colored cloth fitted well, and a toque of the
same material with no trimming, except a knot of
velvet ribbon, was becoming; yet March, who designed
his sister’s costumes, was quite certain that
gown and hat were homemade and the product of
the wearer’s skill. Both women were unmistakably
gentle in breeding, and the children’s chatter, although
sometimes pert, was not rude or boisterous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>A man entered by the side door while the chatter
was stilling under the supreme attraction of
the savory luncheon, and, after a word to a waiter,
took the chair which had been tilted, face downward,
against the far table at the “courier’s”
order. He was tall, and had an aquiline, intellectual
cast of countenance. His hands—the
artist had an appreciative eye for hands and fingers—were
a student’s; his linen was irreproachable;
his chin and cheeks were blue-shaven, and
his black hair was cut straight across at the back,
just clearing the collar of his coat, instead of
being shingled.</p>

<p>“A clergyman!” deduced Gilchrist, from the
latter peculiarity. “That—not the white choker—is
the trade-mark of the profession. Did barber
or preacher establish the fashion?”</p>

<p>After inspection of the <i>menu</i>, the newcomer
ordered a repast which was sumptuous when compared
with the frugal one course of the seven
seated at the table in the middle of the room.
He took no notice of them nor they of him. His
mien was studiously abstracted. While waiting
for his food he drew a small blotting pad from his
pocket and wrote upon it with a stylographic pen,
his profile keener as his work went on. In pausing
to collect thoughts or choose words the inclination
of his eyes was upward. After his entrance
profound silence settled upon the central table.
Not even the baby prattled. This singular taciturnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
took on significance to the alert wits of
the unsuspected observer when he saw a swift
interchange of looks between the cripple and her
left-hand neighbor, attended by a grimace of such
bitter disdain directed by the junior of the pair
at the student as fairly startled the artist.</p>

<p>The unconscious object of the shaft put up
paper and pen, and addressed himself with deliberate
dignity, upon the arrival of his raw oysters, to
the lower task of filling the material part of him.
He was discussing a juicy square of porterhouse
steak, as March bowed respectfully on his way
out to the girl at the head of the board, a smile
in his pleasant eyes being especially intended for
the dwarfed cripple beside her.</p>

<p>Homer had bolted the last fragment of a huge
segment of custard pie, washed down the crust
with a second jorum of coffee, and sat, satiate
and sheepish, upon the tall stool, awaiting orders.</p>

<p>“The most extraordinary combinery, taken in
all its parts, it was ever my luck to behold,” declared
March Gilchrist at his father’s dinner table
that evening. “Intensely American throughout,
though. I wish I knew whether or not the man
who appropriated the reserved seat was a usurper.
If he were, that spirited little economist of a
courier was quite capable of dispossessing him, or,
at least, of calling the waiter to account for neglect
of duty. And what relation did blind Homer
bear to the party?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear old March!” said his sister affectionately.
“Story weaving in the old fashion! How
natural it sounds! What jolly times you and I
have had over our amateur romances and make
believes! Which reminds me of a remarkable
sermon preached Sunday before last by our new
pastor. (I told you we had one, didn’t I?) The
text was: ‘Six waterpots of stone, containing two
or three firkins apiece!’”</p>

<p>“Absurd!”</p>

<p>“True; but listen! The text was only a hook
from which he hung an eloquent discourse upon
the power of faith to make wine—‘old and mellow
and flavorous,’ <i>he</i> called it—out of what to
grosser souls seems insipid water. It was a plea
for the pleasures of imagination—<i>alias</i> faith—and
elevated our favorite amusement into a fine art,
and the fine art into religion. I came home feeling
like a spiritual chameleon, fully convinced that
rarefied air is the rightful sustenance of an immortal
being. According to our Mr. Wayt, what you
haven’t got is the only thing you ought to be sure
of. Life is a sort of ‘Now you see it and now
you don’t see it’ business throughout. Only,
when you don’t see it you are richer and happier
than when you do. Did you ever think to hear
me babble metaphysics? Now, where are those
portfolios?”</p>

<p>“Make believe that you have overhauled them,
and be blest,” retorted her brother. “There’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
chance to practice your metaphysical cant—with
a new, deep meaning in it, too, which you will
detect when you inspect my daubs. I did some
fairish things in Norway, however, which may
prove that your rule has an exception.”</p>

<p>The Gilchrists freely acknowledged themselves
to be what the son and daughter styled “a mutual
admiration square.” March’s portfolios were not
the only engrossing subject that drew them together
in the library, where coffee and cigars were
served.</p>

<p>May and her father turned over sketches and
examined finished pictures at the table, passing
them afterward to the mother, who was a fixture
in her easy-chair by reason of a head, covered
with crisp chestnut curls, lying upon her lap.
May was her companion and co-laborer, dutiful
and beloved, despite the impetuosity of mood
and temper which seemed inharmonious with the
calmer nature of the matron. The mother’s idol
was the long-limbed fellow who, stretched upon
the tiger-skin rug, one arm cast about her waist,
submitted to her mute fondling with grace as
cheerful as that with which she endured the scent
of the cigar she would not let him resign when he
threw himself into his accustomed place. She
was a good wife, but she never pretended to like
the odor of the judge’s best weed. March’s
cigars, she confessed, were “really delightful.”
Perhaps she recognized in his affluent, joyous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
nature something hers lacked and had craved
all her life; the golden side of the iron shield.
Assuredly, her children drew the ideality in which
they reveled from the father.</p>

<p>The tall, dignified woman who queened it in
the best circles of Fairhill society, and was the
chiefest pillar in the parish which had just called
Mr. Wayt to become its spiritual head, was the
embodiment of what is known as hard sense.
Mind and character were laid out and down in
straight lines. Right was right; duty was duty,
and not to be shirked. Wrong was wrong, and
the shading off of sin into foible was of the devil.
She believed in a personal devil, comprehended
the doctrines of the Trinity, of election and reprobation,
and the resurrection of the physical body.
Twice each Sabbath, once during the week, she
repaired to the courts of the Lord with joys unknown
to worldly souls. The ministry she held
in the old-fashioned veneration we have cast behind
us with many worse and a few better things.
Others might and did criticise the men who wore
white neckties upon weekdays and had their hair
cut straight behind. The hands of the presbytery
had been laid in ordination upon them. That
was a sacred shield to her. In spirit she approached
the awful circle of the church with
bared feet and bent brow. Within it was her
home. To her church her toils were literally
given. For it her prayers continually ascended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>She had looked grave during May’s flippant
abstract of the new preacher’s discourse anent the
six stone waterpots. Her family might suspect
that she could not easily assimilate spiritual bread
so unlike that broken to his flock by a good man
who had been gathered to his fathers six months
before, after a pastorate of thirty years in Fairhill.
Nobody could elicit a hint to this effect
from her lips. Mr. Wayt was the choice of a
respectable majority of church and parish. The
presbytery had accepted his credentials and solemnly
installed him in his new place. Henceforward
he was her pastor, and as such above
the touch of censure. He had been the guest of
the Gilchrists for a week prior to the removal of
his family to the flourishing suburban town, and
received such entertainment for body and spirit
as strengthened his belief in the Divine authority
of the call he had answered.</p>

<p>He left Fairhill four days before March landed
in New York, to meet his wife and children in
Syracuse and escort them to their new abiding
place. During these days the mothers and daughters
of the household of faith had worked diligently
to prepare the parsonage for the reception
of the travelers, Mrs. Gilchrist being the guiding
spirit. And while she drew the shining silk of
her boy’s curls through fingers that looked strong,
yet touched tenderly, the Rev. Percy Wayt,
A. M. and M. A., with feet directed by gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and heart swollen with pastoral affection, was nearing
the domicile of his best “member.”</p>

<p>A long French window upon the piazza framed
the tableau he halted to survey, his foot upon the
upper step of the broad flight leading from the
lawn. It was a noble room, planned by March
and built with his proud father’s money. Breast-high
shelves filled with choice books lined the
wall; above them were a few fine pictures.
Oriental rugs were strewed upon the polished
floor; lounging and upright chairs stood about in
social attitudes. The light of the shaded reading
lamp shone silvery upon Judge Gilchrist’s
head and heightened the brightness of May’s
face. March’s happy gaze, upturned to meet his
mother’s look of full content, might have meant
as much in a cottage as here, but they seemed to
the spectator accessories of the luxurious well-being
which stamped the environment.</p>

<p>He sighed deeply—perhaps at the contrast the
scene offered to the half furnished abode he had
just left—perhaps under the weight of memories
aroused by the family group. He was as capable
of appreciating beauty and enjoying ease as were
those who took these as an installment of the
debt the world owed them. The will of the holy
man who preaches the great gain of godliness
when wedded to contentment, ought to be one
with that of the Judge of all the earth. Sometimes
it is. Sometimes——<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Wayt!” Judge Gilchrist’s proverbially
gracious manner was never more urbane
than as he offered a welcoming hand to his wife’s
spiritual director. “You find us in the full flood
of rejoicing over our returned prodigal,” he continued,
when the visitor had saluted the ladies.
“Let me introduce my son.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt was “honored and happy at being
allowed to participate in the reunion,” yet apologetic
for his “intrusion upon that with which
strangers should not intermeddle.”</p>

<p>While saying it he squeezed March’s hand in
a grasp more nervous than firm, and looked admiringly
into the sunny eyes.</p>

<p>“Your mother’s son will forgive the interruption
when he learns why I am here,” he went on,
tightening and relaxing his hold at alternate
periods. “I brought my wife and babies <i>home</i> to-day.
I use the word advisedly. I left a desolate,
empty house. Merely walls, ceilings, doors, windows,
and floors. A shell without sentiment. A
chrysalis without the germ of life. This was on
last Monday morning.”</p>

<p>By now the brief sentences had come to imply
depth of emotion with which March was unable
to sympathize, and he felt convicted of inhumanity
that this was so.</p>

<p>“I advised Mrs. Wayt of what she would find.
Hers is a brave spirit encased in a fragile frame,
and she was not daunted. You, madam,” letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
go the son’s hand and facing the mother, “know,
and we can never forget what we found when,
weary and faint and travel-stained, we alighted
this afternoon at the parsonage gate.”</p>

<p>With all her native aplomb and half-century of
world knowledge Mrs. Gilchrist blushed, much to
the covert amusement of husband and son. If
the judge had manner Mr. Wayt had deportment,
and with it fluency. His weighty words
pressed her hard for breath.</p>

<p>“Please don’t speak of it!” she hastened to
implore. “We did very little—and I no more
than others.”</p>

<p>“Allow me!” Gesture and tone were rhetorical.
“You—or others under your command—laid carpets
and set our humble plenishing in order.
There is not much of it, but such as it is, it has
followed our varied fortunes so long that it is
endeared by association. You arranged it to the
best advantage. You stocked larders and made
up beds, and kindled the fire upon the household
altar, typified by the kitchen range, and spread a
toothsome feast for our refreshment. You and
your sister angels. If this be not true, then
benevolent pixies have been at work, for, although
we found the premises swept and garnished, not
a creature was to be seen. Generosity and tact
had met together; beneficence and modesty had
kissed each other. I assure you, Mr. Gilchrist”—wheeling
back in good order upon March—“that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
seventeen years of the vicissitudes of a pastoral life
that has had its high lights and depressing shades,
such delicacy of kindness is without a parallel.”</p>

<p>“Let me express my sympathy in the shape of
a cigar,” said March, taking one from the table.
“I brought over a lot, which my father, who is a
connoisseur in tobacco, pronounces fit to smoke.
Should you agree with him, I shall esteem it a
compliment if you will let me send a box to the
parsonage to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt’s was an opaque and not a healthy
complexion. It was mottled now with a curious,
dull glow; the muscles of his mouth twitched.
He waved aside the offering with more energy
than courtesy.</p>

<p>“You are good, sir—very good! But I never
smoke! My nervous system is idiosyncratic.
Common prudence inhibits the use on my part of
all narcotics and stimulants, if principle did not.
To be frank”—inclusively to all present—“I am
what is known as ‘a temperance crank.’ You
may think the less of me for the confession; in
point of fact, I lost one charge in direct consequence
of my peculiar views upon this subject;
but if I speak at all, I must be candid. Believe
me nevertheless, Mr. Gilchrist, your grateful
debtor for the proffered gift. If you will now
and then let a kindly thought of me mingle with
the smoke of your burnt offering, the favor will
be still greater.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I trouble you to say to Mrs. Wayt that
the cook you asked me to engage for her cannot
come until next Monday morning?” said the
practical hostess. Mr. Wayt’s sonorous periods
always impelled her to monosyllabic commonplaces.
“Perhaps she cannot wait so long?”</p>

<p>“I take the responsibility of promising for her,
madam, that she <i>will</i>. Apart from the fact that
her desire to secure a servant recommended by
yourself would reconcile her to a still longer
delay, her household, as at present composed, has
in itself the elements of independence. We have
a faithful, if eccentric, servitor, who has an abnormal
passion for work in all its varieties. He is
gardener, house servant, cook, groom, mason and
builder, as need requires. He mends his own
clothes, cobbles his shoes—and I am not without
a suspicion of his proficiency as a laundryman.”</p>

<p>He rendered the catalogue with relish for the
humor of the situation. The exigencies of parsonage
life which had developed the talents of his
trusty retainer seemed to have no pathos for the
master.</p>

<p>“Where did you find this treasure? And is he
a Unique?” asked May laughingly.</p>

<p>“I believe the credit of raking the protoplasmic
germ out of the slums of Chicago, where we were
then sojourning, belongs to my wife’s sister, Miss
Alling. The atmosphere of our home has warmed
into growth latent possibilities, I fancy. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a white day for poor Tony when the gutter-wash
landed him at our door. Even now he has physical
weaknesses and mental deficiencies that make
him a striking object-lesson as to the terrible
truths of heredity.”</p>

<p>“How many children have you, Mr. Wayt?”
questioned March, with irrelevance verging upon
abruptness.</p>

<p>“George W. Cable’s number—five. You may
recall the witty puzzle he set for a Massachusetts
Sunday School. ‘I have five children,’ he said,
‘and half of them are girls. What is the half of
five?’ ‘Two and a half,’ came from the perplexed
listeners. It transpired, eventually, that the
other half were girls also.”</p>

<p>He was an entertaining man, or would have
been had he been colloquial instead of hortatory.
Yet what he said was telling rather from the
degree of importance he evidently attached to it
than from the worth of the matter. In a smaller
speaker, his style would have been airy. Standing,
as he did, six feet in his slippers, he was
always nearly—occasionally, quite—imposing.
Men of his profession seldom converse well. The
habit of hebdomadal speech-making runs over and
saturates the six working days. Pastoral visitation
is undoubtedly measurably responsible for
the trick of talking as for duty’s sake, and to
a roomful. The essential need of the public
speaker is audience, and to this, actual or visionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he is prone to address himself. Mr. Wayt
could not bid an acquaintance “Good-morning,”
in a chance encounter upon boat or car, without
embracing every passenger within the scope of
his orotund tones, in the salutation. A <i>poseur</i>
during his waking hours, he probably continued
to cater to the ubiquitous audience in his dreams.</p>

<p>“Come out for a turn on the piazza, May!” proposed
March, after the guest had taken his leave.</p>

<p>The night was filled with divine calm. The
Gilchrist house surmounted a knoll from which
the beautiful town rolled away on all sides. In
the distance a glistening line showed where the
bay divided Jersey meadows from the ramparts of
the Highlands. The turf of the lawn was ringed
and crossed by beds of hyacinths and tulips.
The buds of the great horse-chestnut trees were
big with promise; the finer tracery of the elms
against the moonlit sky showed tufts of tender
foliage. Faint, delicious breaths of sweetness
met brother and sister at the upper end of their
walk, telling that the fruit trees were ablow.</p>

<div class="center">
“East or West, Hame is Best!”<br />
</div>

<p class="unindent">quoted March, taking in a mighty draught of
satisfaction. “Not that I brought you out here
to listen to stale Scotch rhymes. Don’t annoy the
precious mother by letting her into the secret,
May, but Mr. Wayt is the man I saw in the restaurant
to-day, and I believe that was his family!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> almost unearthly stillness of the fragrant
May night was, as often happens at that lovely,
uncertain season, the precursor of a rainy day.</p>

<p>Hetty Alling, awakening at four o’clock to plan
for the work that lay before the transplanted
household, heard the first drops fall upon the
tin roof of the piazza under her window like the
patter of tiny, stealthy feet scaling the eaves and
combing, then advancing boldly in rank and rush
until the beat was the reverberant roar of a spring
flood.</p>

<p>It awoke nobody else under the parsonage roof-tree.
Hester slept soundly beside her. She
never slept quietly. In addition to the spinal disease
which warped the poor girl’s figure she suffered
from an affection of the throat that made
her respiration in slumber a rattling snore, interrupted
at regular intervals by a gurgle that
sounded like strangulation. So audibly distressing
was it that her father could not sleep within
two rooms of her, and the healthy occupants of
the intervening nursery complained that “nothing
was done to break Hester of making such a
racket. If she wanted to stop it she could.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Her young aunt and roommate knew better.
Hester had shared her bed for almost nine years.
Mrs. Wayt’s orphaned sister was but fourteen
when she came to live in the parsonage, then
situated in Cincinnati. It had been a hard winter
with the pastor’s wife. While her mother lay
dying in Ithaca, N. Y., her then only daughter, the
first born of her flock, a beautiful, vivacious child
of eight, met with the accident which crippled
and dwarfed her for life. The telegram announcing
Mrs. Alling’s illness was answered by one
saying that Hester was at the point of death.
She had just passed the first doubtful stage upon
the return journey lifeward, when Hetty, in her
new black frock, insisted upon relieving the grief-worn
watcher over the wreck that could never be
put together again.</p>

<p>Lying in strange quarters in a strange town at
the dreariest hour of the twenty-four, Hetty recalled
that as the date when the load of care, now
an integral part of herself, was first fastened upon
her. She had before this likened it to a needle
she had once, in childish wantonness, run under
the bark of a young willow, and seen disappear
gradually from view as the riven bark grew over
it, until, at the end of a year, no vestige of the
steel remained, except a ridge which was never
smoothed away. She was not exactly penniless.
The portion left her by her mother was judiciously
invested by her guardian, and yielded her exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
four hundred dollars a year. It was transmitted
promptly, quarterly, until she was of age, by
which time she was so rooted and grounded in
prudence that she continued to draw the like
amount at equal periods.</p>

<p>“It is enough to dress her,” Mrs. Wayt had
said to her husband, in seeking his sanction to
her offer of a home to one who stood alone in the
world save for her sister, and an uncle who had
lived in Japan for twenty years. “And she is
welcome to her board—is she not, Percy, dear?”</p>

<p>“Welcome, dear love? Can you ask the question
with regard to your only sister—poor
motherless lamb! While we have a roof between
us and the sky and a crust of bread between us
and starvation, she shall share both. Let <i>me</i>
write the letter!”</p>

<p>The epistle was almost tattered with many
readings when Hetty became an inmate of her
brother-in-law’s home. She had not kept it until
now. That was not strange, Fairhill being the
latest in a succession of “settlements” to which
the brilliant gospeler had accepted calls, generally
unanimous and almost invariably enthusiastic.
There were three children at Hetty’s coming—her
own and her mother’s namesake, Hester, and
Percy and Perry, the twin boys. Four had been
born since, but two had not outlived early infancy.
Mr. Wayt would not have been a preacher of the
period had he not enriched some of his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
effective discourses with illustrations drawn from
these personal bereavements.</p>

<p>His celebrated apostrophe to a six-months old
daughter, beginning—“Dear little Susie! She
had numbered but a brief half year of mortal life,
but she was loving and beloved! I seem to feel
the soft strain of her arms about my neck this
moment”—is too familiar to my readers, through
newspaper reports, to need repetition here. The
sermon embodying this gem of poetic and rhetorical
emotion is known to have won him calls to
three churches.</p>

<p>It was still dark when Hetty’s ear caught the
muffled thud of feet upon the garret stairs.
Wherever providence and parish preferences cast
the lot of the Wayts, Homer’s bedroom was
nearest the heavens that were hot by summer and
cold by winter.</p>

<p>“I don’t set no store by ceilin’s,” he told Hetty
when she “wished they could lodge him better.”
“Seems if ’twas naturaler fur to see the beams
purty nigh onto my nose when I fus’ wake in the
mornin’. I’m kind o’ lonesome fur ’em when I
caan’t butt me head agin the top o’ me room
when I’m a mind ter.”</p>

<p>At another time he confided to her that it was
“reel sociabul-like to hear the rain onto the ruff,
clus’ to a feller’s ears o’ nights.”</p>

<p>He was on his way down to the kitchen now to
light the fire. Unless she should interfere, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
would cook breakfast, and serve it upon the table
she had set overnight, and sweep down the stairs
and scrub the front doorsteps while the family
ate the morning meal. He called himself “Tony,”
as did all the family except Hetty and Mrs.
Wayt. The former had found “Homer Smith,
Jr.,” written in a sprawling hand upon the flyleaf
of a songbook which formed the waif’s entire
library. Hetty had notions native to her own
small head. One was that the—but for her—friendless
lad would respect himself the more if
he were not addressed by what she called “a circus
monkey’s name.” For this reason he was
“Homer” to her, and her sister followed her
example because she considered the factotum
and whatever related to him Hetty’s affair, and
that she had a right to designate her chattel by
whatever title she pleased.</p>

<p>Tony had come to the basement door one
snowy, blowy day of a particularly cruel winter,
when Hetty was maid of all work. He stood
knee-deep in a drift when she opened the grated
door and asked, hoarsely but without a touch of
the beggar’s whine, for “a job to keep him from
starvin’.” He was, as he “guessed,” twenty
years of age, emaciated from a spell of “new-money,”
and so nearly blind that the suggestion
of a “job” was pitiably preposterous. Hetty took
him into her neat kitchen, made him a cup of tea,
and cut and plied him with bread and butter until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he asserted that he was “right-up-an’-down chirpy,
jes’ as strong’s enny man. Couldn’t he rake out
the furnace, or saw wood, or clear off the snow,
or clean shoes, or scrub the stairs, or mend broken
things, or wash windows, or peel pertaters, or
black stoves, or sif’ ashes, or red-up the cellar—or—or—somethin’,
to pay for his dinner? I aint
no beggar, ma’am—nor never will be!”</p>

<p>Hetty hired him as a “general utility man,” at
ten cents a forenoon and his breakfast, for a
week—then, for a month. He lodged wherever
he could—in stable lofts, at the police station,
under porches on mild nights, and when other
resorts were closed, in a midnight refuge, and
never touched liquor or tobacco in any form.
At the month’s end, his girlish patroness cleared
a corner of the attic between the sharp angle and
the chimney, set up a cot, and allowed him to
sleep there. Mr. Wayt had no suspicion of the
disreputable incumbent of the habitation honored
by his name and residence, until one memorable
and terrible March midnight when a doctor must
be had without the delay of an instant revealed
the secret, but under circumstances that strengthened
the retainer’s hold upon his employers.
Since then, he had been part and parcel of the
establishment, proving himself as proficient in
removals and settlings-down as in other branches
of his business.</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt liked to allude to him as “Hetty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Freak.” At other times he nicknamed him
“Kasper Hauser.” Once, and once only, in reference
to Hetty’s influence over the being he chose
to regard as half-witted, he spoke of him as “a
masculine Undine,” whereupon his sister-in-law
turned upon him a look that surprised him and
horrified his wife, and marched out of the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt followed her presently and found
her gazing out of the window of the closet to
which she had fled, with livid face and dry eyes
that were dangerously bright.</p>

<p>“Percy hopes you were not hurt by his harmless
little jest,” said the gentle wife. “You
know, Hetty, it would kill me if you and he were
to quarrel. He has the kindest heart in the
world, and respects you too sincerely to offend
you knowingly. You must not mind what
sounds like extravagant speech. We cannot
judge men of genius as we would ordinary people.
And, dear, for my sake be patient!”</p>

<p>The girl yielded to the weeping embrace of the
woman whose face was hidden upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wayt”—she never gave him a more
familiar title—“cannot hurt me except through
you, Fanny. You and he must know that by
now. I will try to keep my temper better in
hand in future.”</p>

<p>Hetty was young and energetic, and used to
hard work. She had put the children to bed early
on the evening of their arrival in Fairhill; sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
her sister, who had a sick headache, to her chamber
before Mr. Wayt returned from the Gilchrists’;
given Hester’s aching limbs a hot bath
and a good rubbing, and only allowed Homer to
help her unpack boxes until half-past ten, not
retiring herself until midnight. The carload of
furniture, which had preceded the family and
been put in place by the neighborly parishioners,
looked scantily forlorn in the roomy manse. The
Ladies’ Aid Association had asked the privilege
of carpeting the parlors, dining room, stairs, and
halls, and Judge Gilchrist, instigated by his wife,
headed a subscription that fitted up the pastor’s
study handsomely. The sight of this apartment
had more to do with Hetty’s short speech last
night and her down-heartedness this morning
than the newness of quarters and the knowledge
of the nearly spent “housekeeping purse.”</p>

<p>“The people will expect us to live up to that
study!” she divined shrewdly, staring into the
blackness that began to show two gray lights
where windows would shape themselves by and
by. “And we cannot do it—strain and save and
turn and twist as we may. We are always cut
out on a scant pattern, and not a button meets
without starting a seam. How sick and tired
I am of it all! How tired I am of <i>everything!</i>
What if I were to lie still as other girls—as <i>real</i>
young ladies do—and sleep until I’m rested
out—rested all through! I should enjoy nestling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
down among the pillows and pulling the covers
about my head, and listening to the rain, as much
as the laziest butterfly of them all. What’s the
use of trying to keep things on their feet any
longer when they must go down with a crash
sooner or later?</p>

<p>“I’m <i>awfully</i> sorry for Hetty Alling!” This
was the summing up of the gloomy reverie. In
saying it inwardly, she raised herself to pinch
the pillow savagely and double it into a higher
prop for her restless head. “She is lonely and
homesick and hasn’t a friend in the world. She
never can have an intimate friend for reasons she
knows so well she is sometimes ready to curse
God and die.</p>

<p>“There! Hester, dear! I only moved you a
little to make you lie easier. No! it is not time
to get up. Don’t talk, dear, or you’ll wake yourself
up.”</p>

<p>She was never cross with the afflicted child,
but in her present mood, the moan and gurgle of
her obstructed respiration went through her
brain like the scraping of a saw. The change of
position did not make the breathing more quiet,
and Hetty got up with the general out-of-tune-ativeness
best expressed by saying that “one’s
teeth are all on edge.” She dressed by candlelight,
to save gas, and groped her way down the
unfamiliar backstairs to the kitchen.</p>

<p>It was commodious and well-appointed, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a pleasant outlook by daylight. In the dawn
that struggled in a low-spirited way through the
rifts in the rain and refused to blend with the
yellow blink of her candle and Homer’s lantern,
no chamber could be less than dismal.</p>

<p>Homer was on his knees in front of the flickering
fire, at which he stared as if doggedly determined
to put it out of countenance.</p>

<p>“Now”—his way of beginning nine out of every
ten sentences—“this ere’s a new pattern of a range
to me, an’ it’s tuk me some time fur ter git holt
on it. Most new things comes awk’ard to most
folks.”</p>

<p>Hetty blew out her candle, and, dropping into
a chair in physical and mental languor, sat watching
the grotesque figure clearing away ashes and
cinders. His wrestle with the new pattern had
begrimed his pale face and reddened his weak
eyes. His matutinal costume of a dim blue
flannel shirt, gray trousers, and a black silk skull
cap cast off by Mr. Wayt, pushed well back upon
the nape of the neck and revealing a scanty
uneven fringe of whitey-brown hair, did not
provoke the spectator to a smile.</p>

<p>“There is no bringing <i>him</i> up to the tone of
that study!” she meditated grimly. “He and I
are hopeless drudges, but he is the happier of the
two. Homer! I believe you really <i>love</i> to work!”
she broke forth finally.</p>

<p>Homer snickered—a sudden spurt that left him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
very sober. His laugh always went out like a
damp match.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, cert’nly, ma’am! Ef ’twant fur work,
there wouldn’t be nuthin’ to live fur!”</p>

<p>He shambled off to the cellar with the ashpan,
and in a few minutes, she could distinguish in the
sounds rumbling and smothering in the depths
beneath her feet the melancholy tune of his
favorite ditty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“On the banks of the Omaha—maha!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">’Twas there we settled many a night.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As happy as the little bird that sparkled on our block</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the banks of the Omaha!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hetty raised the window and leaned out, gasping
for breath. A garden lay behind the house
and on one side of it. It was laid out in walks
and borders, and was rather broad than deep.
Beyond this were undefined clumps of trees that
looked like an orchard. Roofs and chimneys and
spires and lines of other trees, marking the course
of streets, were emerging from the soaking mists.
Five o’clock struck from a tower not far away,
and then a church bell began to ring gently—a
persuasive call to early prayers.</p>

<p>The warm, sweet, wet air that aroused her to
look over the sill at a row of hyacinths in full
bloom, the slow peal of the bell, the hush of the
early morning, did not comfort her—but the soft
moisture that filled her eyes drew heat and bitterness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
out of her heart. When she went up to
awaken Hester she carried a spray of hyacinth
bells, weighted with fragrant drops. Fine gems
of rain sprinkled her hair, her cheeks were cool
and damp, the scent of fresh earth and growing
things clung to her skirts. She laid the flowers
playfully against the heavy lids lifted peevishly
at her call.</p>

<p>“‘There’s richness for you,’” she quoted. “A
whole bed of them is awaiting your inspection
in the garden. And such lovely pansies—some
as big as the palm of your hand. You and I and
Homer, who is wild with delight over them, will
claim the flowers as our especial charge and property.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the classification!” snapped
Hester. “Yet we do belong to backyards as
naturally as cats and tomato cans. At least
Homer and I do. You’d climb the fence if you
could.”</p>

<p>“With the other cats?” said Hetty lightly.
“See! I am putting the hyacinths in your own
little vase. I unpacked your china and books last
night. Not a thing was even nicked. You shall
arrange them in this jolly corner cupboard after
breakfast. It looks as if it were made a-puppose,
as Homer says. He has bumped his head against
strange doors and skinned his poor nose against
unexpected corners twenty times this morning.
He says: ‘<i>Now</i>—I s’pose it’s the bran-new house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
what <i>ox</i>cites me so. I allers gits <i>ox</i>cited in a
strange place.’”</p>

<p>The well-meant diversion was ineffectual.</p>

<p>“His oxcitement ought to be chronic, then!
Ugh! that water is scalding hot!” shrinking from
the sponge in Hetty’s hand. “For we’ve done
nothing but ‘move on’ ever since I can recollect.
I overheard mother say once, with a sort of reminiscent
sigh, that our ‘longest pastorate was in
Cincinnati.’ We were there just four years. We
were six months in Chillicothe, and seven in
Ypsilanti. Then there was a year in Memphis,
and eighteen months in Natchez, and thirteen in
Davenport. The Little Rock church had a strong
constitution. We stayed there two years and
one week. It’s <i>my</i> opinion that <i>he</i> is the Wandering
Jew, and we are one of the Lost
Tribes.”</p>

<p>She smiled sour approbation of her sarcastic
sally, jerking her head backward to bring Hetty’s
face within range of her vision. The deft fingers
were fastening strings and straps over the misshapen
shoulders. The visage was grave, but
always kind to her difficult charge.</p>

<p>“You think that is irreverent,” Hester fretted,
wrinkling her forehead and beetling her eyebrows.
“It isn’t a circumstance to what I am thinking all
the time. Some day I shall be left to myself and
my bosom devil long enough to spit it all out.
It’s just bottling up, like the venom in Macbeth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
witches’ toad that had sweltered so long under a
stone. But for you, crosspatch, all would have
been said and done long ago.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t make your mother unhappy if
you could help it,” Hetty said cheerily. “And
it isn’t flattering to her to compare her daughter
to a toad.”</p>

<p>Hester was silent. As she sat in Hetty’s lap,
it could be seen that she was not larger than a
puny child of seven or eight. The curved spine
bowed and heightened the thin shoulders; she
had never walked a step since the casualty that
nearly cost her her life. Only the face and hands
were uninjured. The latter were exquisitely
formed, the features were fine and clearly cut, and
susceptible to every change of emotion. That the
gentle reproof had not wrought peaceable fruits
was apparent from her expression. The misfit in
her organization was more painfully perceptible
to herself early in the day than afterward. She
seemed to have lost consciousness of her unlikeness
to other people while asleep, and to be compelled
to readjust mental and physical conditions
every morning. Hetty dreaded the process, yet
was hardly aware of the full effect upon her own
spirits, or why she so often went down to breakfast
jaded and appetiteless.</p>

<p>“I often ask myself,” resumed Hester, with slow
malignity, repulsive in one of her age and relation
to those she condemned—“if children ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
really honor their parents. We won’t waste
ammunition upon <i>him</i>—but there is my mother.
She is a pattern of all angelic virtues, and a
woman of remarkable mental endowments. You
have told me again and again that she is the best
person you ever knew—patient, heroic, loving,
loyal, and so on to the end of the string! You
tell over her perfections as a Papist tells her
beads. The law of kindness is in her mouth; and
her children shall arise and call her blessed, and
she ought not to be afraid of the snow for her
household while her sister and her slave Tony are
to the fore. Don’t try to stop me, or the toad
will spit at you! I say that this, one would
think, impossible She, the modern rival of Solomon’s
pious and prudish wise woman—is weak
and unjust and——”</p>

<p>Hetty interrupted the tirade by rising and laying
the warped frame, all a-quiver with excitement,
upon the bed.</p>

<p>“You would better get your sleep out”—covering
her up. “When you awake again you will
behave more like a reasonable creature. I cannot
stay here and listen to vulgar abuse of your
mother and my best friend.”</p>

<p>She said it in firm composure, drew down the
shades, and without another glance at the convulsed
heap sobbing under the bedclothes, left
the chamber. Outside the door she paused as if
expecting to be recalled, but no summons came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
She shook her head with a sad little smile and
passed down to the breakfast room.</p>

<p>Father, mother, and four children were at the
table. Mr. Wayt, in dressing jacket, slippers, and
silk skull cap, a cup of steaming chocolate at his
right hand, was engrossed in the morning paper.
A pair of scissors was beside his plate, that he
might clip out incident or statistics which might
be useful in the preparation of his wide-awake
sermons. He made no sign of recognition at the
entrance of his wife’s sister; Mrs. Wayt smiled
affectionately and lifted her face for a good-morning
salute, indicating by an expressive gesture
her surprise and pleasure at having found
room and meal in such attractive order. Long
practice had made her an adept in pantomime.
The boys nodded over satisfactory mouthfuls;
pretty Fanny pulled her aunt down for a hug as
she passed; even the baby made a mute rosebud
of her mouth and beckoned Hetty not to overlook
her.</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt’s digestion was as idiosyncratic as
his nervous system. While the important unseen
apparatus carried on the business of assimilation,
the rest of the physical man was held in quiescent
subjugation. Agitation of molecular centers
might entail ruinous consequences. He reasoned
ably upon this point, citing learned authorities in
defense of the dogma that simultaneous functionation—such
as animated speech or auricular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
attention and digestion—is an impossibility, and
referring to the examples of dumb creatures to
prove that rest during and after eating is a natural
law.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes above the margin of his
newspaper at the clink of the chocolate pot
against the cup in Hetty’s hand. The questioning
gaze met a goodly sight. His wife’s sister
wore a buff gingham, finished at throat and wrists
with white cambric ruffles, hemmed and gathered
by herself. Her dark brown hair was in perfect
order; her sleeves were pushed back from strong,
shapely wrists. She always gave one the impression
of clean-limbedness, elasticity, and neatness.
She was firm of flesh and of will. The prettier
woman at the head of the table was flaccid beside
her. The eyes of the younger were fearless in
meeting the master’s scrutiny, those of his wife
were wistful, and clouded anxiously in passing
from one to the other.</p>

<p>“For Hester,” said Hetty, in a low voice, looking
away from Mr. Wayt to her sister. “She is
tired, and will take her breakfast in bed.”</p>

<p>“I remonstrate”—Mr. Wayt’s best audience
tones also addressed his wife—“as I have repeatedly
had occasion to do, against the practice of
pampering an invalid until her whims dominate
the household. Not that I have the least hope
that my protest will be heeded. But as the
child’s father, I cannot, in conscience, withhold it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Light scarlet flame, in which her features
seemed to waver, was blown across Hetty’s face.
She set down the pot, poured back what she had
taken from it, and with a reassuring glance at her
sister’s pleading eyes, went off to the kitchen.
There she hastened to find milk, chocolate, and
saucepan, and to prepare a foaming cup of Hester’s
favorite beverage; Homer, meanwhile, toasting
a slice of bread, delicately and quickly.</p>

<p>Hester’s great eyes were raised to her aunt
from lids sodden with tears; her lips trembled
unmanageably in trying to frame her plea.</p>

<p>“Forgive me! please forgive me!” she sobbed.
“You know what my morning fiend is. And I
am not brave like you, or patient like mother!”</p>

<p>Hetty fondled the hot little hands.</p>

<p>“Let it pass, love. I was not angry, but some
subjects are best left untouched between us.
Here is your breakfast. Homer says that I
‘make chawkerlette jes’ the same’s they did for
him in the horspittle when he had the new-money.’
They must have had a French <i>chef</i> and
a marvelous <i>menu</i> in that famous ‘horspittle.’ It
reminds me of Little Dorritt’s Maggie and her
‘’evenly chicken,’ and ‘so lovely an’ ’ospittally!’”</p>

<p>She had the knack of picking up and making
the most of little things for the entertainment of
her hapless charge. Mrs. Wayt was much occupied
with the other children, to whom she devoted
all the time she could spare from her husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
It happened occasionally that he would eat no
bread she had not made, and oftener that his
craving was for certain <i>entrées</i> she alone could
prepare to his liking. She brushed his coat and
hat, kept the run of missing papers and handkerchiefs,
tied his cravats, sat by him in a darkened
room when he took his afternoon siesta, wrote
letters from his dictation, and, when he was
weary, copied in a clear, clerkly hand or upon his
typewriter, sermons and addresses from the notes
he was wont to pencil in minute characters upon
a pocket pad. At least four nights out of seven
she arose in the dead of darkness to read aloud
to him for one, three, and four hours, when the
baleful curse, insomnia, claimed him as her prey.
His fad, at this date, was what Homer tickled
Hester into hysterics by calling “them horsephates.”
Horsford’s acid phosphate, if the oracle
were to be believed, ought to be the <i>vade mecum</i>
of ailing humanity. He carried a silver flask containing
it in his pocket everywhere; dropped the
liquid furtively upon a lump of sugar, and ate it
in the pulpit, during anthem, or voluntary, or
offertory; mixed it with water and drank it on
the cars, in drugstores, in private houses, and at
his meals, and Mrs. Wayt kept spirit lamp
and kettle in her bedroom with which to heat
water for the tranquilizing and peptic draught at
cock-crowing or at midnight. If she had ever
complained of his exactions, or uttered an ungentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
word to him, neither sister nor child had
heard her. She would have become his advocate
against himself had need arisen—which it never
did.</p>

<p>“My ministering angel,” he named her to the
Gilchrists, his keen eyes softened by ready dew.
“John Randolph said, in his old age, of his
mother: ‘She was the only being who ever understood
me.’ I can say the same of my other and
dearer self. She interprets my spirit intuitions
when they are but partially known to myself.
She meets my nature at every turn.”</p>

<p>She met it to-day by mounting guard—sometimes
literally—before the door of his study—the
one room which was entirely in order—while he
prepared his discourses for the ensuing Sabbath.
The rest found enough and more than enough to
do without the defended portal. Fanny was shut
up in the dining room with the baby Annie, and
warned not to be noisy. The twins carried
bundles and boxes up and downstairs in their
stocking-feet; Homer pried off covers with a
muffled hammer, and shouldered trunks, empty
and full, leaving his shoes at the foot of the stairs.
Hester said nothing of a blinding headache and a
“jumping pain” in her back while she dusted
books and china. Hetty was everywhere and
ever busy, and nobody spoke a loud word all day.</p>

<p>“You might think there was a corpse in the
study instead of a sermon being born!” Hester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
had once sneered to her confidante. “I never
hear him preach, but I know I should be reminded
of the mountain that brought forth a
mouse.”</p>

<p>One of her father’s many protests, addressed <i>at</i>
Hetty and <i>to</i> his wife, was that their eldest born
was “virtually a heathen.”</p>

<p>“Home education in religion, even when
administered by the wisest and tenderest of
mothers—like yourself, my love—must still fall
short of such godly nurture and admonition as
are contemplated in the command: ‘Forsake not
the assembling of yourselves together.’ There is
didactic theology in David’s holy breathing: ‘A
day in thy courts is better than a thousand.’”</p>

<p>“Better than a thousand in the same place? I
should think so,” interposed Hester’s tuneless
pipe. “He needn’t have been inspired to tell us
that! Family worship suffices for my spiritual
needs. That must be the porch to the ‘courts,’
at least.”</p>

<p>In speaking she, too, looked at her mother, although
every word was aimed at her father.</p>

<p>“It is a cruel trick that we have!” Hetty had
said of the habit. “Every ball strikes that much-tried
and innocent woman, no matter who
throws it.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” retorted the sarcastic daughter.
“And must while the angle of incidence is equal
to that of reflection.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>In the discussion upon family <i>versus</i> church
religion she carried her point by a <i>coup d’état</i>.</p>

<p>“Pews and staring pewholders are all well
enough for straight-backed Christians!” she
snarled. “I won’t be made a holy show of to
gratify all the preachers and presbyteries in
America!”</p>

<p>Anything like physical deformity was especially
obnoxious to Mr. Wayt. The most onerous
duties pertaining to his holy office were visitation
of the sick and burial of the dead. Hester’s beautiful
golden hair, falling far below her waist, veiled
her humped shoulders, and her refined face looking
out from this aureole, as she lay in her
wheeled chair, would be picturesquely interesting
in the chancel, if not seen too often there. The
coarse realism of her refusal routed him completely.
With an artistic shudder and a look of
eloquent misery, likewise directed at his wife, he
withdrew his forces from the field. That night
she read “Sartor Resartus” to him from three
o’clock until 6 <small>A. M.</small>, so intolerable was his
agony of sleeplessness.</p>

<p>It happened so often that Hetty was the only
responsible member of the family who could remain
at home with the crippled girl, that neither
Mr. nor Mrs. Wayt seemed to remark that her
churchgoing was less than nominal. Hester
called Sunday her “white-letter day,” and was
usually then in her best and most tolerant temper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
while her fellow-sinner looked forward to the
comparative rest and liberty it afforded as the
wader in marshlands eyes a projecting shoulder
of firm ground and dry turf.</p>

<p>It was never more welcome than on the fair
May day when the Fairhill “people” crowded the
First Church to hear the new pulpit star.</p>

<p>“The prayer which preceded the sermon was a
sacred lyric,” said the Monday issue of the <i>Fairhill
Pointer</i>. “In this respect Rev. Mr. Wayt is
as remarkably gifted as in the oratory which
moved his auditors alternately to tears, and
smiles, and glows of religious fervor. We regret
the impossibility of reporting the burning stream
of supplication and ascription that flowed from
his heart through his lips, but a fragment of the
introduction, uttered slowly and impressively, is
herewith given verbatim, as a sample of incomparable
felicity of diction:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Thou</span> art mighty, merciful, masterful, and
majestic. <i>We</i> are feeble, fickle, finite, and fading.’”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>March Gilchrist had his say anent the sample
sentence on the way home from church. He was
not connected with the press, and his criticism
went no further than the ears of his somewhat
scandalized and decidedly diverted sister.</p>

<p>In intuitive anticipation of the reportorial
eulogy, he affirmed that the diction was <i>not</i> incomparable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>“I heard a Georgia negro preacher beat it all
hollow,” he said. “He began with: ‘<span class="smcap">Thou</span> art
all-sufficient, self-sufficient, and <i>in</i>-sufficient!’”</p>

<p>“March Gilchrist! How dreadful!”</p>

<p>They were passing the side windows of the
parsonage, which opened upon a quiet cross street.
May’s laugh rippled through the bowed shutters
of the dining room behind which sat a girl in a
blue flannel gown, holding upon her knee and
against her shoulder a hunchbacked child with a
weirdly wise face. They were watching the
people coming home from church.</p>

<p>“A religious mountebank is the most despicable
of humbugs,” said March’s breezy voice, as
he whirled a pebble from the walk with his cane,
and watched it leap to the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Hester twisted her neck to look into Hetty’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“They are discussing their beloved and eloquent
pastor! My heart goes out to those two
people!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Hetty!</span> do you ever think what it would be
like to be engaged?”</p>

<p>“Engaged to do what?” said Hetty lazily.</p>

<p>She lay as in a cradle, in a grassy hollow under
an apple tree—the Anak of his tribe. The
branches, freighted with pink and white blooms,
dipped earthward until the extreme twigs almost
brushed the grass, and shut in the two girls arbor-wise.
The May sun warmed the flowers into
fragrance that hinted subtly of continual fruitiness.
Hester said she tasted, rather than smelled
it. Bees hummed in the boughs; through the
still blandness of the air a light shower of petals
fell silently over Hetty’s blue gown, settled upon
her hair, and drifted in the folds of the afghan
covering Hester’s lower limbs.</p>

<p>Homer had discovered in the garden fence a
gate opening into this orchard, and confidentially
revealed the circumstance to Hetty who, in time,
imparted it to Hester, and conspired with her to
explore the paradise as soon as the boys and
Fanny were safely off to Sunday School.</p>

<p>“Engaged to do what?” Hetty had said in such
good faith that she opened dreamy eyes wide at
the accent of the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“To be married, of course, Miss Ingenuous!
What else could I mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h!” still more indolently. “I don’t
know that I ever thought far in that direction.
Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you, or any other healthy and
passably good-looking girl, expect to be engaged—and
be married—and be happy? It is
time you began to take the matter into consideration,
if you never did before.”</p>

<p>“There is usually another party to such an
arrangement.”</p>

<p>“And why not in your case?”</p>

<p>“Where should he come from? Is he to drop
from the moon? Or out of the apple tree”—stirred
to the simile by the flick of a tinted petal
upon her nose. “Or am I to stamp him out of
the earth, <i>à la</i> Pompey? And what could I do
with him if he were to pop up like a fairy prince,
at this or any other instant?”</p>

<p>“Fall in love with him, and marry him out-of-hand!
I <i>wish</i> you would, Hetty, and take me to
live with you! That is one of my dearest dreams.
I have thought it all out when the backache keeps
me awake at night, and when I get quiet dreamy
hours by day, when <i>he</i> is off pastoraling, and the
boys and Fan are at school, and baby Annie is
asleep, and I can hear Tony crooning ‘Sweet Julia’
so far away I can’t distinguish the frightful words,
and you are going about the house singing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
yourself, and blessing every room you enter like
a shifting sunbeam.”</p>

<p>“Why, my pet, you are talking poetry!”</p>

<p>Hetty raised her head from the arms crossed
beneath it, and stared at the child. The light,
filtered through the mass of scented color, freshened
her complexion and rounded the outlines of
her face; her solemn eyes looked upward; her
hands lay together, like two lily petals, upon the
coverlet. Unwittingly she was a living illustration
of her father’s theory of the Reality of the
Unseen.</p>

<p>“No!” she answered quietly. “Not poetry,
for it may easily come to pass that you should
have a husband and home of your own. I do
dream poems sometimes, if poetry is clouds and
sunsets and music nobody else hears, and voices—and
love words—and bosh!”</p>

<p>Hetty could not help laughing.</p>

<p>“Tell me some of the glory and the bosh! This
is a beautiful confessional, Hester; I wish we had
nothing to do for a week but to lie on the grass,
and look at the blue sky through apple blossoms.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” breathed her companion softly, and
for a while they were so quiet that the robins,
nesting upon the other side of the tree, began to
whisper together.</p>

<p>“Bosh and my poetry dreams are synonyms,”
resumed Hester, her voice curiously mellowed
from its accustomed sharpness. “Other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
may say as much of theirs. I <i>know</i> it of mine.
There’s the difference. All the same they are as
sweet as the poisoned honey we were reading
about the other day, which the bees make from
poppy fields. And while I suck it, I forget. My
romance has no more foundation than the story
of the Prince and the Little White Cat. Mine
is a broken-backed cat, but she comes straight
in my dreams after her head is cut off. You
don’t suppose she minded <i>that!</i> She must
have been so impatient when the Prince hesitated
that she was tempted to grab his sword
and saw through her own neck. You see she
recollected what she had been. The woman’s
soul was cooped up in the cat’s skin. And I
was eight years old when the evil spell was laid
upon <i>me!</i>”</p>

<p>The tears in Hetty’s throat hindered response.
Never until this instant, with all her love for her
dependent charge, her knowledge of her sufferings,
and the infinite pity these engendered, had
the deprivations Hester’s affliction involved
seemed so horribly, so atrociously cruel. The
listener’s nails dug furrows in her palms, she set
her teeth, and looking up to the unfeeling smile
of the deaf and dumb heavens, she said something
in her heart that would have left faint hope of
her eternal weal in the orthodox mind of her
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Hester was speaking again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Every painter has his models. I have had
mine. I dress each one up and work the wires
to make him or her go through the motions—my
motions, mind you! not theirs, poor puppets!
When the dress gets shabby, or the limbs rickety,
I throw them upon the rubbish heap, and look
out for another.</p>

<p>“I got a new one last Thursday. The man
who jumped over me in the station, and afterward
carried me into the restaurant (such <i>strong</i>, steady
arms as he had!) is a real hero! Oh, I am building
a noble castle to put him in! He lives near
here, for he passes the house three times a day.
His eyes have a smile in them, and his mustache
droops just like Charles I.’s, and he walks with a
spring as if he were so full of life he longed to
leap or fly, and his voice has a ring and resonance
like an organ. The pretty girl that called him
‘Mark’ to-day, is his sister.”</p>

<p>“Why not his wife?”</p>

<p>“Wife! Don’t you suppose I know the cut of
a married man, even on the street? He hasn’t
the first symptom of the craft. He doesn’t swagger,
and he doesn’t slink. A husband does one
or the other.”</p>

<p>Hetty laughed out merrily. There was a sense
of relief in Hester’s return to the sarcastic raillery
habitual to her, which made her mirth the
heartier.</p>

<p>A man crossing the lower slope of the orchard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
heard the bubbling peal, and looked in the direction
of the big tree. So did his attendant, a huge
St. Bernard dog. He tore up the acclivity, bellowing
ferociously. Before his master’s shout
arose above his baying he was almost upon the
girls. At the instant of alarm, Hetty had thrown
herself before the wheeled chair and the helpless
occupant, and faced the foe. Crouching slightly,
as for a spring, her face blenched, eyes wide and
steady, she stood in the rosy shadow of the
branches, both hands outthrown to ward off the
bounding assailant.</p>

<p>“What a pose!” was March’s first thought, professional
instinct asserting itself, concerned
though he was at the panic for which he was responsible.
In the same lightning flash came—“I’ll
paint that girl some day!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened!” he was calling, as he
ran. “He will not hurt you!”</p>

<p>Hester had shrieked feebly, and lay almost
swooning among her cushions. Hetty had not
uttered a sound, but, as the master laid his hand
on the dog’s collar her knees gave way under her,
and she sank down by the cripple’s chair, her
head resting upon the edge of the wicker side.
She was fighting desperately for composure, or
the semblance of it, and did not look up when
March began to apologize.</p>

<p>“I am awfully sorry,” he panted, ruefully penitent.
“And so will Thor—my dog, you know—be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
when he understands how badly he has behaved.
He is seldom so inhospitable.”</p>

<p>The words brought up Hetty’s head and wits.</p>

<p>“Are we trespassing?” she queried anxiously.
“We thought that this orchard was a part of the
parsonage grounds, or we would not have come.
It is we who should beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“By no means!” He had taken off his hat, and
in his regretful sincerity looked handsomer than
when his eyes had smiled, concluded Hester,
whose senses were rapidly returning. “My name
is Gilchrist, and my father’s grounds adjoin those
of the parsonage. He had the gate cut between
your garden and the orchard, that the clergyman’s
family might be as much at home here as
ourselves. I hope you will forgive my dog’s misdemeanor,
and my heedlessness in not seeing you
before he had a chance to frighten you.”</p>

<p>Summoning something of his father’s gracious
stateliness, he continued, more formally:</p>

<p>“Have I the pleasure of addressing Miss
Wayt?”</p>

<p>Bow and question were for Hetty. Hester’s
voice, thin and dissonant, replied with old-fashioned
decorum of manner, but in unconventional
phrase:</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> have the misfortune to be Miss Wayt. This
is Mr. Wayt’s wife’s sister, Miss Alling.”</p>

<p>It was a queer speech, made queerer by the
prim articulation the author deemed proper in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
situation. March tried not to see that the subject
of the second clause of the introduction
flushed deeply, while her mute return of his bow
had a serious natural grace he thought charming.
When he begged that she would resume her seat,
the little roguish curl at the corner of her lips,
which he recollected as archly demure, came into
play.</p>

<p>“We have no chairs to offer, but if you do not
object to the best we have to give”—finishing
the half invitation by seating herself upon a grass-grown
root, jutting out near the trunk of the
tree.</p>

<p>“The nicest carpet and lounge in the world,”
affirmed March, sitting down upon the sward.
“Odd, isn’t it, that American men don’t know
how to loll on the turf as English do? Our
climate is ever so much drier and we have three
times as many fair days in the year, and some of
us seem to be as loosely put together. But we
don’t understand how to fling ourselves down all
in a heap that doesn’t look awkward either, and
be altogether at ease in genuine Anglican fashion.
Even if there are ladies present, an Englishman
lies on the grass, and it is considered ‘quite the
thing, don’t you know?’ They say the imported
American never gets the hang of it, try as he will.
A man must be born on the other side or he can’t
learn it.”</p>

<p>“There may be something in your countryman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
born reverence for women that prevents him
from mastering the accomplishment,” said Hetty,
a little dryly.</p>

<p>March bowed gayly.</p>

<p>“Thank you for the implied compliment in the
name of American men! I am glad you are getting
the benefit of this perfect May day. There,
at any rate, we have the advantage of the Mother
Country, if she <i>has</i> given us the Maypole and
‘The Queen of the May.’ This is a sour and
dubious month in Merry England.”</p>

<p>“You have been there, then?”</p>

<p>Hester said it abruptly, as she said most things,
but the eagerness dashed with longing that gave
plaintive cadence to the question, caught March’s
ear.</p>

<p>“Several times. I sailed from Liverpool twelve
days ago. I was just off the steamer, and may
be a little unsteady on my feet, when I collided
with your carriage last Thursday, and you generously
forgave me.”</p>

<p>The girl was regarding him with frank admiration
that would have annoyed an ultra-sensitive
man, and amused, while it flattered, a vain one.</p>

<p>“It must be <i>heavenly</i> to travel in the country
of Scott and Dickens!” she said, quaintly naïve.
“How you must have enjoyed it!”</p>

<p>“I did, exceedingly, but less on account of
‘David Copperfield’ and ‘Nicholas Nickleby’
than because, as a boy, I reveled in English history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and that my mother’s father, for whom I was
named, was English. You should hear my sister
talk of her first journey across England. She
would say every little while in an awed undertone:
‘This is just <i>living</i> Dickens!’ You have not met
her yet, I think?” to Hetty.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The tone was reserved, without being rude.
He could have fancied that sadness underlay civil
regret. Perhaps May had been mistaken in postponing
her call until the parsonage was in perfect
order.</p>

<p>“She means to call very soon. She thought it
would be unneighborly to intrude before you had
recovered from the fatigue of removal and travel.
Mr. Wayt was my father’s guest for a day or
two, you know, before your arrival, and I have
since had the pleasure of meeting him several
times and of hearing him preach this morning.”</p>

<p>In the pause that succeeded the speech the
church bell began to ring for afternoon service.
Under the impression that he had lost caste in
not attending upon the second stated ordinance
of the sanctuary he offered a lame explanation.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am not an exemplary church-goer.
But I find one sermon as much as I can
digest and practice from Sunday to Sunday. My
mother doesn’t like to hear me say it. She
thinks such sentiments revolutionary and uncanonical,
and no doubt she is right.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anybody is excusable for preferring to worship
‘under green apple boughs’ to-day,” observed
Hester, with uncharacteristic tact. “You see we
have always lived in cities, great and small. We
have been used to brick walls and narrow, high
houses, with paved backyards, with cats on the
fences”—disgustfully—“and wet clothes flapping
in your eyes if you tried to pretend to ruralize.
Everybody hasn’t as much imagination as Young
John Chivery, who said the flapping of sheets
and towels in his face ‘made him feel like he was
in groves.’”</p>

<p>“Fairhill has preserved the rural element
remarkably well, when one considers her tens of
thousands of inhabitants, her water supply and
electric lights,” said March; “and luckily one
doesn’t need much imagination to help out his
enjoyment of the world on this Sunday afternoon.”</p>

<p>His tone was so respectfully familiar, his bearing
so easy, the girls forgot that he was a stranger.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t your Dickens who said it, but you
can, perhaps, tell me who did write a verse that
has been running in my unpoetical brain ever
since I entered your fairy bower,” he said by and
by.</p>

<p>“That is the way it goes, I believe. It is a
miracle for me to recollect so much rhyme. The
robins and bees must have helped me out.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew who did that!” sighed Hester.
“Oh! what it must be to write poetry or paint
pictures!”</p>

<p>March’s glance of mirthful suspicion changed
at sight of the knotted brow and wistful eyes.</p>

<p>“One ought to be thankful for either gift,” he
said quietly. “I was thinking just now how I
should like to make a picture of what I saw as I
ran up the hill. May I try some day?”</p>

<p>Hetty drew herself up and looked inquiry.
Hester’s hands fluttered, painful scarlet throbbed
into her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Can you draw? Do you paint? Are you an
<i>artist?</i>” bringing out the last word in an excited
whisper.</p>

<p>March was too much touched to trifle with her
agitation. “I try to be,” he answered simply,
almost reverently.</p>

<p>“And would you—may I—would it annoy
you—Hetty! ask him. You know what I want!”</p>

<p>“My darling!” The cooing, comforting murmur
was passing sweet. “Be quiet for one
moment, and you can put what you want to say
into words.” As the fragile form quivered under
her hand, a light seemed to dawn upon her.
“You see, Mr. Gilchrist, my niece loves pictures
better than anything else and—she never has met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a real, live artist before,” the corners of her mouth
yielding a little. “She has had a great longing
to know how the beautiful things that delight her
are made—how they grow into being. Is that it,
dear?”</p>

<p>Hester nodded, her eyes luminous with tears
she strove to drive back.</p>

<p>March struck his hands together with boyish
glee.</p>

<p>“I have it! I will make a study of ‘orchards
all a-flutter with pink,’ and you shall see me put
in every stroke. May I begin to-morrow?
Blossom-time is short. How unspeakably jolly!
May we, Miss Alling?”</p>

<p>The proposition was so ingenuous, and Hester’s
imploring eyes were so eloquent, that the referee
turned pale under the heart-wrench demur cost
her.</p>

<p>“Dear!” she said soothingly, to the invalid, “it
would not be right to promise until we have consulted
your mother. Mr. Gilchrist is very kind.
Indeed”—raising an earnest face whose pallor set
him to wondering—“you must believe that we
do appreciate your goodness in offering her this
great happiness. But—Hester, love, we <i>must</i> ask
mamma.”</p>

<p>March had seen Mrs. Wayt in church that forenoon,
and been struck anew with her delicate
loveliness. Could she, with that Madonna face,
be a stern task-mistress? With the rise of difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
his desire to paint the picture increased.
That this unfortunate child, with the artist soul
shining piteous through her big eyes, should see
the fair creation grow under his hand had become
a matter of moment. As poor Hester’s effort to
express acquiescence or dissent died in a hysterical
gurgle, and a shamed attempt to hide her hot
face with her hands, the tender-hearted fellow
arose to take leave.</p>

<p>“I won’t urge my petition until you have had
time to think it over. But I don’t withdraw it.
May I bring my sister over to see you both?
She is fond of pictures, too, and dabbles in watercolors
on her own account. Excuse me—and
Thor—for our unintentionally unceremonious
introduction to your notice, and thank you for a
delightful half-hour. Good-afternoon!”</p>

<p>Hetty looked after him, as his elastic stride
measured off the orchard slope—a contradiction
of strange mortification and strange delight warring
within her. It was as if a young sun-god had
paused in the entrance of a gruesome cave, and
talked familiarly with the prisoners chained to the
walls. With all her resolute purpose to oppose
the intimacy which she foresaw must arise from
the proposed scheme of picture-making, she could
not ignore the straining of her spirit upon her
bonds.</p>

<p>“Oh!” wailed Hester, lowering her hands, “I
didn’t mean to be so foolish! I will be brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and sensible, but you know, Hetty, I have never
had anything like this offered to me before. It
is like dying with thirst with water before one’s
eyes, to give it up. And when he said: ‘Blossom-time
is short,’ it rushed over me that I never
had any—I can never have any. I am just a
withered, useless, ugly bud that will never be a
flower.”</p>

<p>An agony of sobs followed.</p>

<p>“My precious one!” Hetty’s tears flowed with
hers. “Do I ever forget your sorrows? Are you
listening, dear? If possible, you shall have this
one poor little pleasure. You must trust your
mother’s love and mine, to deny you nothing we
can safely give. If we must refuse, it is only
bearing a little more!”</p>

<p>The going out of the May day was calm as
with remembered happiness, but the chill that
lurks in the imperfectly tempered air of the
newborn season, awaiting the departure of the
sun, was so pronounced by seven o’clock that
Hetty called upon Homer to build a fire in the
sitting room, where she and Hester were sitting.
The children were sent to bed at eight o’clock.
Mrs. Wayt was lying down in her chamber
with one of her frequent headaches, rallying
her forces against her husband’s return from the
long walk he found necessary “to work off the
cumulative electricity unexpended by the day’s
services.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“I belong to the peripatetic school of philosophy,”
he said to a parishioner whom he met two
miles from home.</p>

<p>“He was forging ahead like a trained prize-fighter,”
reported the admiring pewholder to a
friend. “Nothing of the sentimental weakling
about <i>him!</i>”</p>

<p>March and May Gilchrist, pausing upon the
parsonage porch, at sound of a voice singing softly
and clearly within, saw, past a half-drawn sash curtain,
Hetty rocking back and forth in the firelight,
with Hester in her arms. The cripple’s
head was thrown back slightly, bringing into relief
the small, fine-featured face and lustrous eyes.
Her wealth of hair waved and glittered with the
motion of the chair like spun gold. It might
have been a young mother crooning to her baby
in a sort of chant, the words of which were distinctly
audible to brother and sister, the nearest
window being lowered a few inches from the top.
Hester loved heat and light as well as a salamander,
but could not breathe freely in a closed room.
To-night was one of her “bad times,” and nothing
but Hetty’s singing could win her a moderate
degree of ease.</p>

<p>March moved forward hastily to ring the bell.
He felt like an eavesdropping spy upon the unconscious
girls. Without any knowledge of the
isolation and mutual dependence of the two, the
visitors perceived pathos in the scene—in the
clinging helplessness of one and the brooding tenderness
expressed in the close clasp and bent
head of the other.</p>

<p>The singing ceased instantly at the sound of
the gong. “By George! what an alarm!” muttered
March, discomfited by the clang succeeding
his touch. “And I gave it such a genteel pull!”</p>

<p>His attitude was apologetic still, when Mr.
Wayt’s wife’s sister opened the door.</p>

<p>“I seem fated to be heralded noisily!” he said
regretfully. “I had as little idea of the tone of
your doorbell as you had of the power of Thor’s
lungs. Miss Alling, let me introduce my sister!
She gave me no peace until I brought her to see
you.”</p>

<p>May extended her hand with unmistakable intention
of good fellowship.</p>

<p>“I scolded him for stealing a march upon me
this afternoon while I, like a dutiful Christian,
was in church,” she said. Her smile was her
brother’s, her blithe, refined tones her own. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I mean to improve my advantages the more diligently
on that account.”</p>

<p>The genial persiflage had bridged over the
always awkward transit from front door to drawing
room when the host is the conductor. It was
the more embarrassing in this case because the
two meagerly furnished parlors were unlighted
except as a glimmer from the hall gas added to
the sense of space and emptiness.</p>

<p>“Allow me!” March took from Hetty’s fingers
the match she had lighted, and reached up to the
chandelier. The white illumination flashed upon
a pleasing study of an up-looking manly face, with
honest, hazel eyes, drooping mustache, and teeth
that gleamed in the smile attending the question:
“I hope your niece is none the worse for her
fright?”</p>

<p>“Thank you! I think not. She is rather nervous
than timid, and not usually afraid of dogs.”</p>

<p>“I hope we can see her to-night?” May took
up the word. “My brother says she is such a
dainty, bright little creature that I am impatient
to meet her.”</p>

<p>Hetty’s eyes glowed with gratitude and surprise.
No other visitor had ever named the
afflicted daughter of the house in this tone. The
frank, cordial praise kept back no implication of
pitying patronage. Mr. Wayt’s wife’s sister had
knocked about the world of churches and parishes
long enough to know that the perfect breeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
which ignores deformity without overlooking the
deformed is the rarest of social gifts. In any
other circumstances, she would have refused
steadfastly to subject Hester to the scrutiny of a
stranger. As it was, she hesitated visibly.</p>

<p>“She is seldom able to receive company in the
evening. But I will see how she is feeling to-night.”</p>

<p>She had remarkable self-possession, as March
had noted already. She got herself out of the
room without mumble or halt. She walked well,
and with a single eye to her destination, with no
diffident conjectures as to how she moved or
looked. March had keen perceptions and critical
notions upon such points.</p>

<p>“What an interesting looking girl,” observed
May, in an undertone.</p>

<p>And March, as cautiously—“I hope she will let
us see the little one! She is the jolliest grig you
can conceive of.”</p>

<p>Both tried not to look about them while
waiting for the hostess’ return. The place was
forlornly clean, and the new carpets gave forth
the ungoodly smell of oily wool that nothing
but time and use can dissipate. Plaintive efforts
to abolish stiffness were evident in chairs grouped
in conversational attitudes near the summer-fronted
fireplace, and a table pulled well away
from the wall, with books and photographs lying
about on it. March could fancy Hetty doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
these things, then standing disheartened, in the
waste of moquette, under the consciousness that
there was not one-fifth enough furniture for the
vast rooms. At this point, he spoke again subduedly:</p>

<p>“What possessed the church to build these
desolate barns and call them family parlors?”</p>

<p>May was a parish worker, and looked her surprise.</p>

<p>“A parsonage must have plenty of parlor room
for church sociables.”</p>

<p>“Then those who use them ought to furnish
them. Or, say! it wouldn’t be amiss to keep
them up as show places are abroad—by charging
a shilling admission fee.”</p>

<p>Hetty’s return saved him from deserved rebuke.</p>

<p>“My niece will be very happy to see you,” she
reported, rather formally, her eyes darkling into
vague trouble or doubt as she said it. On the
way across the hall she added hurriedly to May:
“We never overpersuade her to meet strangers.
In this case there was no need.”</p>

<p>May’s gloved hand sought hers with a swift,
involuntary gesture. It was the merest touch
that emphasized the low “Thank you!” but both
struck straight home to Hetty’s heart. The Gilchrist
tact was inimitable.</p>

<p>Hester lay upon a lounge, propped into a sitting
posture with pillows. Her hair and drapings
were cunningly disposed. A casual eye would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
not have penetrated the secret of the withered
limbs and curved spine. A red spot like a rose-leaf
rested upon each cheek, her eyes shone, and
her silent smile revealed small, perfect teeth like
a two-year-old baby’s. She was so winsome that
May stooped impulsively to kiss her as she would
a pretty child.</p>

<p>“I came to tell you how angry we all are—my
father, mother, and I—with my brother and his
dog for scaring you to-day,” she said, seating herself
on an ottoman by the lounge, and retaining
hold of the wee hand until it ceased to twitch and
burn in hers. “I did think Thor knew better!
His tail committed innumerable apologies to me
when I told him I hoped to see you this evening.”</p>

<p>March and Hetty, chatting together near the
crackling wood fire, caught presently sentences
relative to colors and pencils and portfolios, and
slackened their talk to listen. May had elicited
the confession that Hester’s brush was a solace
and the only pastime she had “except reading
and Hetty’s music.”</p>

<p>“But it’s only trying with me,” said the tuneless
voice. “I have had no teacher except Hetty.”</p>

<p>“My dear Hester!” cried the person named.
“Be candid, and say ‘worse than none!’”</p>

<p>Hester colored vividly at this evidence that her
confidences to her new friend were shared by
others, but rallied gallantly to support her assertion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“She doesn’t think she has any talent for drawing,
but she took lessons for three months that
she might teach me how to shade and manage
perspective, and use water colors. She and I
amuse ourselves with caricatures and all that, and
I make drawings—very poor ones—to illustrate
poems and stories, while she reads to me, and I
do a little—you can’t imagine <i>how</i> little and how
badly!—in color. Just bits, you know—grass
and mossy sticks, and brambles running over
stones, and frost-bitten leaves—and such things.
Hetty is always on the lookout for studies for me.
I cannot sit up long enough to undertake anything
more important if I had the skill. And I
shouldn’t dare venture to copy anything really
beautiful—such as apple blossoms,” with a short-lived
smile at March that left a plait between her
eyes.</p>

<p>Intercepting Hetty’s apprehensive glance, he
smiled in return, but forbore to introduce the
petition left with them that afternoon. May had
been stringent on this point.</p>

<p>“Don’t allude to it this evening!” she enjoined
upon him. “Nothing is in worse taste than to
use a first call as a lever for selfish ends. I’ll run
in to-morrow morning, and try my powers of persuasion.
Meantime, get your canvas and palette
ready.”</p>

<p>Hetty’s spirits rose when she perceived that the
exciting topic was avoided. The four were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the swing of merry converse when the clock struck
nine, and, as if he had waited for the signal, Mr.
Wayt walked in. March, who sat by Hetty, saw
her stiffen all over, and her eyes sink to the floor.
Hester began to cough irrepressibly—a hard, dry
hack, to quiet which Hetty went to get a glass of
water. The pallor of the pastor’s face had a
bilious tinge; his eyes were sunken, his whole
appearance haggard and wild. Yet his greeting
to the guests was effusive, his flow of language
unabated. Neither daughter nor sister-in-law
offered to second him. Hester’s roses faded, the
ever present fold between her eyebrows was
almost a scowl. Hetty was coldly imperturbable,
and the Gilchrists soon made a movement to go.</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt stepped forward airily to accompany
them to the door, Hetty falling into the rear and
parting from them with a grave bow upon the
threshold of the sitting room.</p>

<p>“My regards to your estimable parents,” said
the host on the porch, his pulpit tone carrying
far through the night. “A clerical friend of mine
dubbed Judge Aaron Hollingshed of Chicago, an
active elder in his church, and his wife, who was
a true mother in Israel—‘Aaron and <i>her!</i>’ I
already, in spirit, apply the like titles to Judge
and Mrs. Gilchrist. It is such spirited support as
theirs that upholds the hands of the modern
Moses against the Amaleks of the day. Thank
you for calling, and good-night to you both.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">May Gilchrist</span> had not overestimated her persuasive
powers. A call on Mrs. Wayt, undertaken
as soon as she had seen, from her watch
window, the tall, black figure of the clergyman
issue from his gate, and take his way down-town,
won his wife’s sanction to the presence of her sister
and daughter in the orchard that afternoon to
watch Miss Gilchrist’s brother upon a sketch he
proposed to begin before the apple blossoms fell.</p>

<p>“I shall be there, of course,” the young diplomatist
mentioned casually. “I am studying art
in an amateurish way, under my brother’s direction.
I dearly enjoy seeing him paint. His
hand is so firm and rapid, and his eye so true!
Your daughter tells me she is fond of drawing.
March and I would be only too happy to render
any assistance in our power to forward her studies
in that line.”</p>

<p>“My sister has spoken to me of your kindness
and his,” Mrs. Wayt answered thoughtfully.
“She told me also that she had referred the
question of accepting Mr. Gilchrist’s generous
proposition to me. Hesitation seems ungracious,
but my poor child is very excitable, and in nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
so unfit to work long at anything that I have
doubted the expediency of allowing her to become
interested in her favorite pursuit to the
extent necessary for the acquisition of any degree
of skill.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless May went home victorious, and
Mrs. Wayt, disquiet in eye and soul, sought her
sister and detailed the steps of the siege and the
surrender.</p>

<p>“Refusal was impossible without risking the
displeasure of influential parishioners, or exciting
suspicions that might be more hurtful,” she concluded.</p>

<p>Hetty was cleaning silver in the dining room.
Over her buff gingham she wore a voluminous bib
apron; housewifely solicitude informed her whole
personality. Her hair was turned back from her
temples, and the roughened roll showed rust-red
lights in a bar of sunshine crossed by her head as
she moved. The lines of her face had what Hester
called “their forenoon <i>sag</i>,” a downward inclination
that signified as much care as she could bear.
She rubbed a tablespoon until she could see each
loosened hair and drooping line in it, before
unclosing her thinned lips to reply. Even then
her speech was reluctant.</p>

<p>“The child is yours, Frances—not mine, dearly
as I love her. I understand as well as you how
cruel it seems to deny her what is, in itself, a
harmless pleasure. Still, we have agreed up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
this time that it is inexpedient to give people the
run of the house, and this looks like a straight
road to that.”</p>

<p>She did not glance up in speaking, or afterward.
Her accent was unimpassioned, her
thoughts apparently engrossed in the business of
bringing polish out of tarnish.</p>

<p>“There are circumstances that may alter cases—and
premises,” returned Mrs. Wayt deprecatingly.
“I cannot but feel that we may begin to
argue and determine from a different standpoint.
I wish you could be a little more sanguine, dear.”</p>

<p>“You don’t wish it more than I do, sister! I
wasn’t built upon the ‘Hope on, Hope ever’ plan.
My utmost effort in that direction is to make the
best of what cannot be bettered. And since you
have said ‘Yes’ to this painting scheme we will
think only of what a boon it will be to Hester.
The new cook is a more imminent difficulty. This
house is large, and the salary excellent, I admit,
but it would have been wise to wait until our
arrival before engaging her.”</p>

<p>She knew that her sister was as much surprised
as herself at Mr. Wayt’s commission to Mrs.
Gilchrist, also that the wife would not plead this
ignorance in self-defense.</p>

<p>“Homer, you, and I could have divided the
housework, as we did in other places,” continued
Hetty, attacking a row of forks, now that the
spoons were done with, “and we could hire a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
woman by the day to wash and iron. The cook
may justify Mrs. Gilchrist’s recommendation. I
dare say she will. Only—but I’ll not utter
another croak to-day! You are an angelic optimist,
and I am given over to pessimism of the
opposite type. We will accept Mary Ann and
the rest of the goods the Fairhill gods provide,
including the open-air studio, eat, drink, and be
merry, and make up our minds that to-morrow we
<i>won’t</i> die! I’d seal the covenant with a kiss if I
were quite certain that I am not silicon-ed up
to the eyes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt bore a pained and heavy heart to
the nursery and her mending basket. She loved
Hetty fondly, and with what abundant reason no
one knew so well as the heroic wife of a selfishly
eccentric man. She trusted her sister’s sterling
sense, and in most instances was willing to abide
by her judgment, but there were radical differences
in their views upon certain subjects. The
very pains Hetty took to avert open discussion
of what lay like a carking blight upon the spirits
of both caused friction and rawness, and the
feigned levity with which she closed the door
upon the topic would have been insult from anyone
else. She had no alternative but to submit,
no help but in the Refuge of all pure souls
tempted almost out of measure by the sins and
perversities of those dearest to them. Upon the
knees of her heart she besought wisdom and comfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and—sweet satire upon the pious duty of
self-examination!—forgiveness for her intolerance
of others’ foibles!</p>

<p>Baby Annie was building block houses upon
the floor, and filling them with dandelions.
Homer had brought a small basketful up to her
just before Mrs. Wayt was summoned to her
visitor, and had helped the child erect a castle
while the mother was below. Upon her entrance,
he shuffled out as sheepishly as if she had detected
him rifling the pockets of her husband’s Sunday
clothes. These lay over a chair by her work
table. While she prayed, her fingers plied the
needle upon a ripped lining and two loose
buttons.</p>

<p>“See, mamma,” entreated the little one. “So
many dandeyions! Annie make house for dee
papa!” The mother stooped to kiss her; a tear
splashed upon the mass of wilting golden disks
packed into papa’s treasure chamber. At the
same age Hester had prattled of “dee papa,” and
was his faithful shadow wherever he would allow
her to follow. He had been too busy of late
years and too distraught by various anxieties to
take much notice of the younger children, but he
had made a pet of little Hester. He used to call
her “Lassie with glory crowned,” as he twined and
burnished her sunny curls around his fingers.
Annie was a loving little darling, but neither so
sprightly nor so beautiful as her first-born at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
same age. She worshiped her father, and he
was beginning to recognize and be pleased by her
preference.</p>

<p>“Poor Percy!”</p>

<p>“Papa sick?” asked the child, startled by the
ejaculation.</p>

<p>“No, my darling. Papa is very well. Mamma
is only sorry! sorry! <i>sorry!</i>”</p>

<p>“Sorry! sorry! <i>sorry!</i> Mamma sorry! sorry!
<i>sorry!</i>” While she crammed the yellow flowers
into the castle, the baby made the words into a
song, catching intonation and emphasis as they
had escaped her mother’s lips.</p>

<p>Dandelions dying were as fair to her as dandelions
golden-crisp in the meadow grass. A drop
of blood, red from the heart, would mean no more
than a coral bead.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, Hester’s chair was drawn by
Homer into the orchard. The painter, his sister,
his dog, and his easel were already in place.
March had sketched in the arbor, and indicated
the figures sufficiently to reveal the purpose of
the picture.</p>

<p>Blossom-time is short, but fortunately the
weather that week was phenomenally equable for
May. In eight days the painting was finished.
The reader may have noticed it at the Academy
exhibition the next winter, where it was catalogued
as “The Defense.” Hetty’s portrait and
pose were admirably rendered, and the bound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the big St. Bernard was fiercely spirited. But
the wonder of the group was the occupant of the
low wicker carriage.</p>

<p>“My baby daughter!” faltered Mrs. Wayt,
on first seeing it, and no more words would
come.</p>

<p>To herself and to March, later and confidentially,
Hetty spoke of it as “Hester glorified.” At
times, she was almost afraid to look at it. It was
the face of an infant, but an infant whose soul
had outleaped the limitations of years. The filmy
gold of her hair lay, cloudlike, about her, her perfectly
molded hands were clasped in the fearless
delight of ignorance as she leaned forward to welcome
the enemy her custodian was ready to beat
off. It was Hester in every lineament.</p>

<p>Even the baby knew it. But it was Hester as
her brothers and sisters would never see her unless
among the fadeless blossoms of the world where
crooked things will be made straight.</p>

<p>March Gilchrist was not poetical except with
his brush. It was his tongue, his song, his story.
Through it Hetty Alling first learned to know
him, yet they were never strangers after that earliest
meeting in the orchard. She was a capital
sitter, and he lingered over her portrait as he
dared not over Hester’s for fear of wearying her.
While Hetty posed, and he painted, May and
Hester became warm friends. Miss Gilchrist had
her own sketchbook, and March improvised an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
easel for it, which was attached to the wheeled
chair, in desk fashion. Under May’s tutelage
Hester made a study of apple blossoms, and
another of plumy grasses which the overlooker
praised with honest warmth, and promised to
keep forever as souvenirs of the “pink-and-white
week.” The robins were so used to the sight
of the social group that they exchanged tender
confidences freely overhead, as to summer plans
and prospective birdlings. Thor’s massive bulk
crushed, daily, the same area of sunny turf, and
he may have had canine views as to the folly of
working when the sun was warm and the sod
softest. The orchard, where every tree was a
mighty bouquet, was an impervious screen between
the party and the streets and such windows
as commanded the slope.</p>

<p>“It is paradise, with rows upon rows of shining,
fluffy angels to keep out the rest of the
world!” said Hester, on the afternoon of the last
sitting. “I’m glad it is we who are inside! And
not another soul!”</p>

<p>March was dabbling his brushes in a wide-mouthed
bottle of turpentine, preparatory to putting
them up.</p>

<p>“Nothing exclusive about her—is there?” he
laughed to Hetty, in mock admiration.</p>

<p>She answered in the same vein:</p>

<p>“She was always an incorrigible aristocrat!”</p>

<p>“Say a beggarly aristocrat, and free your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
mind!” retorted Hester good-humoredly. “I
don’t care who knows it. Who doesn’t prefer a
select coterie to a promiscuous ‘crush’? I’d like
to dig out this orchard just as I would a square
of turf, and set it down in the middle of the
South Seas (wherever they may be) where the
trees wouldn’t shed their blossoms the whole
year round, and we four—with the robins and
Thor thrown in ornamentally—might paint and
talk and live forever and a day. I used to wonder
what answer I would make to the fairy who
offered three wishes—but I am quite ready for
her now. I’d fuse them all into one!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? Going! Going! the last call!
<i>Gone!</i>” cried March, bringing down his biggest
brush, <i>à la</i> auctioneer’s hammer, upon Thor’s
head.</p>

<p>“Gone it is!” responded Hester, folding her
tiny hands upon her heart, and closing her eyes
in an ecstasy of satisfaction. “Let nobody speak
for five minutes. (Look at your watch, Mr. Gilchrist!)
For five minutes we will make believe
that the deed is done, and we are translated. I
hear the surf on the shores of the</p>

<div class="verse">Where the winds never sigh, and the skies never weep.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>They humored this one of her caprices, as they
had others. She was full of fancies, some odd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
some ghastly, some graceful. Even practical
May yielded obedience to the mandate, and, laying
her head against the bole of the tree, met the
bright eye of the mother robin peering over the
edge of her nest with what May chose to interpret
as a wink of intelligent amusement.</p>

<p>“She asked me as plainly as dumb show could
ask, who would provide three meals a day for the
happy exclusives, and, when I alluded to breadfruit
trees and beefsteak geraniums, wanted to
know where ovens and gridirons would come
from,” said May afterward; “That formed the
basis of <i>my</i> five-minute reverie.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>So runs the poem, between the lines of which
might be written the exultant, “<i>Absent from the
body!</i>” Hester’s soul had the poet’s power of
“drifting” into absolute idealization. She was
used to building with dream stuff. In the time
she had allotted, she lived out a lifetime, to
tell of which would require hours and many
pages. That she paid for the wide sweep into
the remote and the never-to-be, by reaction bitterer
than death, never dissuaded her from other
voyages of the “winged boat.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>For perhaps sixty seconds Hetty, sitting upon
the turf by the recumbent Thor, and idly pulling
his shaggy hair, reflected regretfully upon this
certain reflex action; then, as if uttered in her
ear, recurred the words: “Where we four might
paint, and talk, and <i>live</i> forever!”</p>

<p>“We four!” Involuntarily, her eye sped from
one to another of the group; from May’s placid
visage and smile upraised to the robin’s nest, to
the face framed about by pale blue cushions—colorless
as wax, the pain lines effaced by the
sweet exaltation oftenest seen upon the forehead
and mouth of a dead child—consciousness, rising
into majesty, of having compassed all that is given
to the human creature to know, the full possession
of a happy secret to be shared with none
who still bear the weight of mortality. Hetty’s
heart slackened its beat while she gazed upon the
motionless features. Her “child” was, for the
time, rapt beyond her reach. Yet it was only
“make believe” after all, that snared her into
temporary bliss!</p>

<p>Before the pang of the thought got firm hold
of her she met March Gilchrist’s eyes, full, and
fixed upon hers.</p>

<p>He lay along the grass, supporting himself on
his left elbow, his cheek upon his hand, the other
hand, still holding the big brush, had fallen across
Thor’s back. His eyes were startled, as by an
unexpected revelation, and as her glance touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
them, sudden, glad light leaped from depth to
surface. He would not release her regard—not
even when the glow that succeeded the numbness
of the thrill stole from limb to limb, and suffused
her face, and all the forceful maiden nature
battled with the magnetic compulsion. The
sough of the spring breeze in the flower-laden
branches, likened by Hester to the whispering
surf upon island sands; the humming bees and
twittering birds; the sun-warmed scent of apple
blooms and white clover and the sweetbrier growing
just without the canopy of the king apple
tree; the faint flush of light strained through
locked masses of blossoms, were, for those
supreme moments, all the world—except that this
man—God’s most glorious creation—spoke to
her, although his lips were moveless, and that the
stir of a new and divine life within her heart
replied.</p>

<p>“I am sure the time must be up!” said May
yawningly. “Poor Hester is fast asleep, and my
tongue aches with holding it so long.”</p>

<p>Hester unclosed her eyes slowly, smiled
dreamily, and essayed no denial. March was on
his knees, collecting brushes and tubes into his
color box. Hetty was folding a rug so much
too heavy for her wrists that May sprang to seize
the other end.</p>

<p>“Why—are you chilly? Your fingers are like
ice!” she exclaimed, as their hands met. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
how you shiver! I am afraid we have been selfish
in keeping you out of doors so long!”</p>

<p>The ague shook the mirth out of the nervous
laugh with which Hetty answered:</p>

<p>“Now that the strain of the week’s suspense
and sittings is over, and the result of our joint
labors is a pronounced success, I am a little tired.
The spring is a trifle crude as yet, too,” she subjoined,
speaking more glibly than usual. “By
the time the sun reaches the tops of the trees, we
begin to feel the dew fall. Hester, we must go
in!”</p>

<p>March took the handle of the wheeled chair
from her. “That is too heavy for you on the
thick grass. May, will you abide by the stuff
until I come back?”</p>

<p>On every other afternoon, Homer had come
down at five o’clock to roll the carriage up the
ascent. Hester lay among the pillows, her eyes
again shut, and the reflection of the happy secret
upon her face. Hetty walked mutely beside her.</p>

<p>March liked the fine reserve that kept her
silent and forbade her to risk another encounter
of glances. She was all womanly, refined in
every instinct. Crushing the young grasses with
foot and wheel, and bowing under the stooping
branches, they made their way to the gate in the
parsonage fence. Homer shambled hurriedly
down the walk to meet them.</p>

<p>“Now”—he stammered, laying hold of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
propeller of the chair—“I’d ’a bin yere sooner,
but I had to go downtown on an arrant——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” said March good-naturedly.
“I was happy to bring Miss Wayt up the hill.
Good-by, Queen Mab! May I have the honor of
taking you to my home studio to see the picture
when it is varnished and framed?”</p>

<p>She replied by a gentle inclination of the head,
and the same joyous ghost of a smile. She was
like one lost in a dream, so deep and delicious
that he will not move or speak for fear of awakening.</p>

<p>March raised his hat and stood aside to let the
carriage pass. As Hetty would have followed, his
offered hand barred the way.</p>

<p>“One moment, please!” he said, in grave simplicity.
“I have to thank you for some very
happy hours. May I, also, thank you for the
hope of many more? I should be sorry if our
acquaintanceship were to fall to the level of social
conventionality. We have always been intimate
with our pastor’s family, and mean, unless forbidden,
to remain true to time-honored precedent.”</p>

<p>If he had alarmed her just now, he would prove
that he was no love-smitten boy, but a purposeful
man, who understood himself and was obedient
to law and order. Hetty gathered herself together
to emulate his tranquillity.</p>

<p>“I especially want to thank <i>you</i>, out of her
hearing, for the great kindness you and your sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
have showed to my dear little invalid. She
will never forget it, nor shall I. It has been the
happiest week of her life. I think but for your
offer to lend her books, and Miss Gilchrist’s
promise to keep on with her painting lessons, that
the end of our sittings would be a serious affliction
to her. Please say this from me to Miss Gilchrist,
also. Good-evening!”</p>

<p>He ran lightly back to May and “the stuff.”
He had not obtained permission to call, but
neither was it refused. He liked dignity in a
woman. As he phrased it, “it furred the peach
and dusted the plum.” He was entirely willing
to do all the wooing.</p>

<p>May innocently applied the last touch to his
unruffled spirit in their family confabulation in
the library that evening.</p>

<p>“That Hetty Alling is one of the most delightful
girls I ever met!” she asseverated emphatically.</p>

<p>“In what respect?” inquired her judicial parent.</p>

<p>“She has individuality—and of the best sort.
She is intelligent, frank, spirited, and with these
sterling qualities, as gentle as a saint with poor
little Hester, who must be a great care to one
so young as Hetty. I mean to do all I can to
brighten the monotonous existence the two girls
must lead. From all I can gather without asking
impertinent questions, they are thrown almost
entirely upon one another for entertainment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
happiness. It is an oddly assorted household,
taken as a whole.”</p>

<p>“Talking of originality,” observed March after
a meditative puff or two, “you have it in the
niece. It is fearfully sad that such a mind should
be crowded into the body of a dwarf. She dotes
upon books. If you will look up a dozen or so
that you think she—or Miss Alling—would enjoy,
I will take them over to-morrow.”</p>

<p>His mother’s attitude changed slightly, although
her face was unaltered. She seemed to
hold her breath to listen, her whole inner being
to quicken into intensity of interest. March,
stretched luxuriously upon the rug, in his usual
post-prandial attitude, felt her sigh.</p>

<p>“Do I tire you, mother, dear?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Never, my boy!”</p>

<p>Nor ever would, although within the hour and
with a throe that tested her reserves of fortitude,
she had surrendered the first place in his heart.
The blow was unexpected. The orchard paintings
and her children’s interest in them had
seemed entirely professional to her. March had
sketched dozens of girls, and fallen in love with
none of them. With all his warmth of heart and
ready sensibilities, he was not susceptible to feminine
charms. As a boy, he became enamored of
art too early to have other flames. Perhaps, with
fatuity common to mothers, she reasoned that
with such a home as his he was not likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
tempted by visions of domestic bliss under a vine
and fig tree yet to be planted. It is a grievous
problem to the maternal intellect why men who
have the best mothers and sisters living and eager
to spoil them with much serving, should be the
earliest to marry out of certainty into hazardous
uncertainty.</p>

<p>When the judge had gone to a political meeting,
and May to entertain visitors in the drawing
room, Mrs. Gilchrist divined the purport of the
impending communication. Her fair hand grew
clammy in toying with the short chestnut curls;
in the silence through which she could hear the
tinkle of the fountain on the lawn, she wet her
dry lips that they might not be unready with loving
rejoinder to what her idol was preparing to
say. She knew March too well to expect conventional
preamble. He was always direct and
genuine. She did not start when he spoke at
length.</p>

<p>“Mamma, darling.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my son.”</p>

<p>“It has come to me at last, and in earnest.”</p>

<p>“I surmised as much.” It was plain to see
where he got his dislike of circuitous methods.
“Is it Mrs. Wayt’s sister?”</p>

<p>“It is Hetty Alling. She is a true, noble
woman. I shall try to win her love. Should I
succeed, you will love her for my sake, will you
not?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know that I will. But this is sudden.
You have known her less than a fortnight. And,
dear, it is out of the fullness of my love that I
speak—I am afraid that the family is a peculiar
one. Be prudent, my son. You are young, and
life is long. I cannot bear that you should make
a mistake here. Should this young girl be all
that you think—even all that I hope to find in
her—it is best not to force her decision. Give
her time to study you. Take time, and make
opportunities to study <i>her</i>. I ask it because you
bear the names of two honorable men—your
father and mine—and because it would break
your mother’s heart to see her only boy unhappy.”</p>

<p>He drew her hand to his lips—the high-bred
hand that would always be beautiful—and held it
there for a moment. She had his pledge.</p>

<p>Hetty had followed Hester into the house. It
was half-past five, and there were strawberries to
be capped for the half-past six dinner. A parishioner
had left a generous supply of Southern berries
at the door while the girls were out, and had
taken Mrs. Wayt and her little daughters to drive.
Aunt and niece sat down at a table drawn before
the dining-room window and fell to work. Hester’s
high chair brought her tiny, dexterous fingers
to a level with Hetty’s. The task went
forward with silent rapidity, and neither noted
the direction of her companion’s eyes. Hetty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
seemed to her dazed self to bear about with her
the charmed atmosphere of the nook under the
king apple tree.</p>

<p>The mingled hum of bees and sighing wind and
bird-note sounded in her ears like the confused
song of a seashell. Now and then, a ray from
hazel eyes flashed athwart her sight. Brain and
heart were in a tumult that terrified her into
questioning her identity. The “winged boat” of
fancy was a novel craft to our woman of affairs.
As novel was the self-absorption that made her
unobservant of Hester’s brilliant eyes and musing
smile. As the dainty fingers, just reddened on
the tips by the fruit, picked off and cast aside the
green “caps,” Hester’s regards were fixed upon
the Anak of the orchard, and Hetty’s strayed continually
to the same point. Both looked over
and beyond a figure creeping on all-fours down
the central alley of the broad, shallow garden,
occasionally crouching low, as if to crop the grass
of the borders.</p>

<p>Perry, studying his Latin grammar in his
mother’s chamber above, awoke the taciturn
dreamers by a shout:</p>

<p>“Hello, Tony! what <i>are</i> you doing there?”</p>

<p>He turned his head, not his body, to reply:</p>

<p>“Now—jes’ lookin’ for somethin’ I dropped.”</p>

<p>“You’ll drop yourself some day if you don’t
watch out!”</p>

<p>Hester’s unmusical cackle broke forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does he look more like a praying mantis—or
Nebuchadnezzar?” she said to her co-worker.
“He reminds me of a funny thing I heard a man
say when I was a child of a picture in my catechism
of Nebuchadnezzar feeding in the pasture
with a herd of cows. He said it was ‘a fine study
of comparative anatomy.’ The advantage would
be on the side of the cows if Tony were to take
the field.”</p>

<p>Hetty could not but laugh with her in looking
at the grotesque object.</p>

<p>“A short sight is a real affliction—poor fellow!
It is to be hoped that he has ‘dropped’ nothing
valuable. I will take the bowl and ‘caps’ into the
kitchen when I have laid you down upon the
lounge. Your poor back must ache by this time.”</p>

<p>She lingered a few minutes in the kitchen to
make sure that everything was in train for dinner.
Her practical knowledge of all departments of
housewifery had already gained for her Mary Ann’s
profound respect. The cook recommended by
Mrs. Gilchrist was a tidy body, a capital worker,
and, as she vaunted herself, “one as took an
<i>intrust</i> in any family she lived in.”</p>

<p>“I ast that pore innocent feller if there was any
parsley in the gairdin,” she chuckled to Hetty,
“an’ he said he’d fetch me a bunch to gairnish
me dishes. But I’ve niver laid eyes onto him
since. I mistrust he don’t know one yarb from
another. Is he ‘all there,’ d’ye think, mem?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is not quick, but he is not an idiot, by
any means,” returned his patroness. “He is a
faithful, honest fellow, always thankful for a kind
word, very industrious, and perfectly truthful.
We think a great deal of Homer. I saw him in
the garden just now, looking for the parsley. I
will find him and send him in with it. Don’t
sugar the berries; we do that on the table. Keep
them in a cool place until they are wanted for
dessert.”</p>

<p>She strolled down the garden walk, singing
low to herself the catching tune to which she had
set the words the Gilchrists had overheard the
Sunday night of their first call:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O Life and Love! O happy throng</div>
<div class="verse">Of thoughts whose only speech is song.</div>
<div class="verse">O heart of man! canst thou not be</div>
<div class="verse">Blithe as the air is, and as free?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Homer had vanished from the main alley that
led directly to the orchard, yet she walked on
down the whole length of it. Blazing tulips had
supplanted faded hyacinths; the faint green
globes of snowball bushes were bleaching hourly
in May sunshine and breeze; the lilac hedge, lining
the post-and-board fence at the bottom of the
parsonage lot, was set thick with purple and
mauve and white spikes.</p>

<p>“Such a dear, old-fashioned garden!” Hetty
said, half aloud. “It reminds me of the one we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
had at home!” Leaning upon the orchard gate
she abandoned herself to reverie. The robins’
whistle in the apple tree was low and tender;
fleecy clouds, drifting toward the west, began to
blush on the sunward side, the blending odors of
a thousand flowers hung in the air. The word
“home” took thought back—thoughts of the only
one she had ever had, and the mother whose
death lost it to her. Since then she had stood
alone, and helped weaker people to stand. A
great longing for rest in a love she could claim
as all hers drove tears to her eyes. The longing
was not new, but the hope that softened it was.
Hitherto, it had been linked with her mother’s
image only. She wanted her now, as much, and
more than ever before, but that she might sympathize
with what she began to comprehend
tremblingly. Her mother would enter into her
trembling and her joy. Especially if she had
seen what Hetty never could describe—a look
the memory of which renewed the shy, delicious
shame expressed in the blush March had pitied,
while rejoicing in the sight of it.</p>

<p>Such a boundless, beautiful world opened to
her while she stood there, looking down the blossoming
vistas of the orchard—solitary, yet comforted!
She would give rein to imagination for
that little while. It could harm no one, even if it
were all a chimera that would not outlast blossom-time.
And must it be <i>that?</i> What had glorified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
other desolate women’s lives might bless
hers. Spring comes to every year, however long
and cruel may have been the winter. Recalling
March’s prophecy of future association, she dared
dwell upon visions of his visits, of the pleasant
familiar talks that would make them better
acquainted; of the books they would read and
discuss; of the pictures he would paint, with her
looking on.</p>

<p>“I am not beautiful or accomplished,” she said
humbly. “But I would make myself more
worthy of him. I am young and apt. I would
make no mistakes that could mortify him. He
should never be ashamed of me, and, oh!” she
stretched her arms involuntarily, as if to draw the
unseen nearer to her heart—“how faithfully I
would serve him, forever and forever.”</p>

<p>The flight of fancy had indeed been fast and
far!</p>

<p>The tinkle of the dinner bell in Mary Ann’s
vigorous hand ended the fond foolishness
abruptly. It was the careful housewife who
asked herself with a guilty start: “What has become
of Homer and the parsley?”</p>

<p>Her first step in returning was upon something
hard. She picked it up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Homer met his young mistress at the back
door. His weak, furtive eyes were uneasy before
she accosted him. At her incisive tone the red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rims closed entirely over them, his hands, grimy
with groping in gravel and turf, fumbled with
one another, and his loose jaw dangled.</p>

<p>“Homer, you said this afternoon that you had
been out to do an errand. Do not leave the
place again without letting me know where you
are going, and for what.”</p>

<p>“Now,” he began wretchedly, “you wasn’t at
home, ’n I thought——”</p>

<p>“I forbid you to think! I will do the thinking
for this family. You knew where to find me. If
you had not, you ought to have waited until I
got back. I mean what I say!”</p>

<p>He shifted miserably from one foot to the
other, and, as she passed him, cleared his dry
throat.</p>

<p>“Now, ’spose Mrs. Wayt was to send me out
in a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Tell her that you have my orders.”</p>

<p>“Now——”</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder at him, impatient
and contemptuous. He had never seen her so
angry with him before. He plucked at the battered
brim of an old military cap clutched in one
hand. He had found it in the garret, and believed
that it became him rarely.</p>

<p>“I was ’bout to say as I hed los’ what I
hed——”</p>

<p>“I found it. Not another word! There is no
excuse for you!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wayt</span> availed himself of an early opportunity
to make known his intention to take no
vacation that year. He “doubted the expediency
of midsummer absences on the part of suburban
pastors.” While many residents of Fairhill went
abroad and to fashionable resorts in America in
July and August, a respectable minority was content
to remain at home, and some of the vacated
cottages and villas were taken by city people, to
whom the breezy heights and shaded lawns were
a blessed relief from miles of scorching stone and
brick. He “foresaw both foreign and domestic
missionary work in his own parish,” he said to his
session in explaining his plans for the summer
campaign.</p>

<p>The resolution was politic and strengthened
his hold upon his new charge. Not to be outdone
in generosity, the people redoubled their
affectionate attentions to their spiritual leader.
Fruits, flowers, and all manner of table dainties
poured into the parsonage; carriages came daily
to offer airings to Mrs. Wayt and the children,
and on the Fourth of July a pretty phaëton and
gentle horse were sent as “a gift to the mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the manse,” from a dozen prominent parishioners.</p>

<p>“Verily, my cup runneth over.”</p>

<p>A real tear dropped upon Mr. Wayt’s shirt
front as he uttered it falteringly on the afternoon
of the holiday. Yet he had been repeating the
words at seasonable intervals, and more or less
moistly, since the hour of the presentation.</p>

<p>The Gilchrists were upon the eastern veranda,
the embowering vines of which were beginning to
rustle in the sea breeze. All had arisen at the
pastor’s appearance, and March set a chair for
him.</p>

<p>“I have thought, sometimes, that I had some
command of language,” he continued unctuously.
“To-day I have no words save those laid to my
use by the Book of books—‘My cup runneth
over.’ It is not one of my foibles to expatiate
upon the better ‘days that are no more.’ The
trick is common and cheap. But to you, my
best friends, I may venture to confide that my
dear wife and I were brought up in what I have
since been disposed to characterize as ‘mistaken
luxury.’ Since the unselfish saint joined her
blameless lot with mine she has never had a carriage
of her own until to-day. I can receive
favors done to myself with a manly show of gratitude.
Appreciation of my wife makes a baby of
me.”</p>

<p>“By this time he should be in his second childhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
then, for everybody likes mamma,” piped
a familiar voice from within the French window
of the library. Glancing around with a start that
was <i>not</i> theatrical, he espied his eldest born
established at her ease in a low chair. Her feet
were on a stool; she wore a white gown, and
May’s white Chudda shawl covered her from the
waist downward; her hair was a mesh of gold
thread that drew to it all the light of the dying
day. May sat on a cushion in the window and
linked Hester in her comparative retirement with
the veranda group.</p>

<p>“Ah, little one, are you there?” said the fond
parent playfully. “I missed you from the dinner
table and might have guessed that you could be
nowhere but here.”</p>

<p>Profound silence ensued, and lasted for a minute.
Hester shrank into herself with a blush
visible even in the shadowy interior.</p>

<p>March and May had gone through orchard
and gardens to fetch her an hour ago. Her
father had eaten his evening meal at the same
table with her. In the circumstances there was
nothing to say, a fact comprehended by all
except the unconscious offender.</p>

<p>“I think Mrs. Wayt will find her horse gentle,”
said Judge Gilchrist, in formal civility too palpable
to his wife.</p>

<p>With intelligent apprehension of the truth, too
often overlooked, that confidence in the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
bearer must precede obedience to his message,
she desired that her husband and son should like
Mr. Wayt. To March she had confessed her fear
that some of the family were “peculiar,” and he
might infer the inclusion of the nominal head
in the category. Further than this she would not
go. With pious haste she picked the fly out of
the ointment, and with holy duplicity beguiled
others into approval of the article that bore the
trade mark of “The Church.”</p>

<p>Ah, the Church!—in every age and, despite
lapses and shortcomings and stains, the custodian
of the Ark of God—her debt to such devout and
loyal souls as this woman’s will never be estimated
until the Master shall make acknowledgment
of it in the great day of reckoning.</p>

<p>When the judge’s turn of the subject and the
“horsey” talk that followed granted his wife
leisure to reconsider the matter, she discovered
that there was no cause for discomfiture. Mr.
Wayt was absent-minded, as were all students
of deep things. Only, her husband was quick of
sight and wit, and neither March nor May had
much to say, of late, of the new preacher who
was doing such excellent work in the congregation.
March went regularly to church and sat
beside his mother through prayer and hymn and
sermon, and afterward refrained from adverse
criticism. This may have been out of respect to
the girl he hoped to make his wife. Yet she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
dared fancy that the graver tenderness of his
behavior to herself and the unusual periods of
thoughtfulness that occurred in their conversations
had to do with the dawning of spiritual life
in his soul. However much certain of Mr. Wayt’s
mannerisms might offend her taste, there was no
question of his ability and eloquence. That these
might be the divinely appointed nets for the
ingathering into the Church of her best beloved
was a burden that weighted every petition.</p>

<p>March had not spoken openly of his love for
Hetty Alling since the evening on which he first
avowed it to his mother, but, in her opinion, there
was nothing significant in this reserve. The Gilchrists
were delicate in their dealings with one
another, never asking inconvenient questions, or
pushing communication beyond the voluntary
stage. If May divined the drift of her brother’s
affections, she did not intimate it by word or look.
When the fruit of confidence was ripe it would
be dropped into her lap. She <i>did</i> note what Mrs.
Gilchrist had not the opportunity of seeing—how
seldom Hetty had leisure to receive March or his
sister. She was getting ready the wardrobe of
the twin boys, who were to go to boarding school
the 1st of October. Through Hester’s talk May
had learned incidentally that the Wayts employed
neither dressmaker nor seamstress.</p>

<p>“Hetty is miraculously skillful with her
needle,” was Hester’s way of putting it, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
so swift that it would drive her wild to see her
work done by the ‘young lady who goes out by
the day.’ I work buttonholes and hem ruffles
and such like, and mamma gives her all the time
she can spare from baby—and other things. But
our Hetty is the motor of the household machine.
I don’t believe there is another like her in the
world. The mold in which she was cast was
broken.”</p>

<p>She had said this in a chat held with her
favorite this evening while the others were engaged
with other themes outside of the window.
May encouraged her to go on by remarking:</p>

<p>“You love her as dearly as if she were really
your sister, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“‘As well!’ The love I have for mother, sisters,
and brothers is a drop in the ocean compared
with what I feel for Hetty! See here, Miss
May!” showing her perfectly formed hands.
“These were as helpless as my feet. Hetty
rubbed me, bathed me, flexed the muscles for an
hour every morning and an hour every night.
She tempted me to eat; obliged me to take exercise;
carried me up and down stairs, and sat with
me in her arms out of doors until she had saved
fifty dollars out of her allowance to have my
chair built. Hetty educated me—made me over!
She is my brain, the blood of my heart—I don’t
believe I should have a soul but for Hetty!”</p>

<p>The warm water stood in May’s eyes. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
weak voice, thrilling with excitement, reminded
her of the danger of an excess of feeling upon the
disjointed system. She spoke lightly:</p>

<p>“Oh, your father would have looked out for
your soul!”</p>

<p>“<i>Would</i> he?”</p>

<p>The accent of intensest acrimony shocked the
listener, corroborated as it was by the bitterness
of scorn that wrung the small face.</p>

<p>In a second Hester caught herself up.</p>

<p>“They say that cobblers’ wives go barefoot.
Ministers have so little time to spare for the souls
of their families that their children are paganed.
If it wasn’t for their wives and their wives’ sisters,
the forlorn creatures would not know who made
them.”</p>

<p>It was a plausible evasion, but it did not efface
from May’s mind the disdainful outburst and
the black look that went with it. Both seemed
so unnatural, even revolting, to a girl whose
father stood with her as the synonym for nobility
of manhood, that she could not get away from
the recollection for the rest of the evening. This
was before Mr. Wayt’s arrival, and sharpened
May’s appreciation of the little by-play between
Hester and her parent.</p>

<p>His departure at nine o’clock was succeeded by
Hester’s at ten, and, as was their habit, March and
his sister took her home by the path across the
orchard. The night was sultry; the moon lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
languid under swathes of gray mist. She looked
warm, and the stars near her faint and tired.
Low down upon the horizon were flashes of purple
sheet lightning. The town had kept the Fourth
patriotically, and the odor of burned paper and
gunpowder tainted the stirless air.</p>

<p>“The grass is perfectly dry,” said May, stopping
to lay her hand upon the mown sward.
“That should be a sign of a shower.”</p>

<p>“There is always rain on the night of the Fourth
of July,” returned March abstractedly.</p>

<p>Hester said not a word. As she looked up at
the sick moon her eyes showed large and dark;
her face was corpselike in the wan radiance.
She was weary, and she had been indiscreet. She
could not sleep without confessing to Hetty her
lapse of temper and tongue, and Hetty had
enough to bear already. She had not been so
strong and bright as was her wont for a month
past. It might be only excessive drudgery over
sewing machine and household duties, but she
looked fagged and sad at times. The phaëton
and horse would benefit mamma and the children—when
the vacant place beside the mistress
of the Manse was not occupied by their lord and
master. <i>He</i> got the lion’s share of every luxury.
Poor Hester’s conscience and heart were raw, and
the heat of the wounds inflamed her imagination.
The evening at the judge’s had not rested her.
That was strange, or would have been had not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
long, black shadow of her father lain across the
memory of it.</p>

<p>The back door of the parsonage stood wide
open, and the house was so still that, as March
stooped to lift Hester from her carriage at the
foot of the steps, he caught the sound of what
was scarcely louder than an intermittent sigh in
the upper story, but continuous as a violent fit of
weeping. The arm that lay over his shoulder
twitched convulsively; Hester shuddered sharply,
then laughed aloud:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Gilchrist! I thought I was falling!
It is too bad to put you to all this trouble. I
hope Tony hasn’t blown himself up. He ought
to have come for me.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I promise your mother to bring you
home safely?” said March reassuringly. And, as
they reached the hall—“May I carry you upstairs?”</p>

<p>The offer seemed to terrify her.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! Just lay me on the settee there!
Somebody will be down directly. Don’t trouble
yourself to bring the chair in. Tony will attend
to that. Thank you! Good-night, Mr. Gilchrist!
Good-night, Miss May!”</p>

<p>While she hurried all this out, a stumble on the
back stairs was the precursor of Homer’s appearance
in the dim recesses of the hall. He alighted
at the bottom of the flight on all-fours, picked
himself up and shambled forward, one hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
his head, the other on his elbow, an imbecile grin
spreading his jaws.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>, I a’most broke me <i>nake</i> on them stairs!”</p>

<p>March had deposited Hester upon the hall
lounge, and although perceiving her anxiety to
get rid of him, hesitated to commit her to the
keeping of a man who was, apparently, but half
awake.</p>

<p>“Let me carry you up!” he insisted to Hester.
“He may fall again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tony is all right!” in the same strained
key as before. “He never lets anything but himself
drop.”</p>

<p>A rustle and swift step sounded above stairs.
Someone ran down. It was Hetty. Her white
wrapper was begirt with a ribbon loosely knotted;
her rust-brown hair was breaking from constraint
and tumbling upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>March’s first pained thought was: “She knew
I would be in, yet did not mean to see me again
to-night!”</p>

<p>A second glance at the colorless face and wild
eyes awakened unselfish concern.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Who is hurt?” she
queried anxiously. Hester’s reply was a shriek
of laughter.</p>

<p>“Nothing! Nobody! Only Tony has broken
his neck again, and Mr. Gilchrist did not know
that it is an hourly occurrence in our family life,
so he insisted upon taking me upstairs himself.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Gilchrist is very kind!” Hetty’s tone was
deadly mechanical; in speaking she looked at
nobody. “I sent Homer down when I heard you
coming. I am sorry he was not in time.”</p>

<p>May had joined the group.</p>

<p>“I hope,” she said in her cheery way, “that
none of the rest of your household have come to
grief to-day?”</p>

<p>Hetty turned to her with eyes that questioned
silently—almost defiantly.</p>

<p>“I mean, of course, did the boys bring home
the proper quantum of eyes and fingers?”</p>

<p>“Yes! oh, yes! thank you! they went to bed
tired, but whole, I believe.”</p>

<p>“That is fortunate, but remarkable for a Fourth
of July report,” said March. “Come, May!
Good-night!”</p>

<p>He had seen, without comprehending, the intense
relief that flooded the girl’s visage at his
sister’s second sentence, also that she was feverishly
anxious to have them go. And the sound
above stairs, hushed by Hester’s shrill tones—was
it low, anguished weeping? The mourner was
not Hetty, yet her dry eyes were full of misery.
His big, soft heart ached with futile sympathy.
By what undiscovered track could he fare near
enough to her to make her conscious of this and
of a love the greatness of which ought to help her
bear her load of trouble?</p>

<p>“Hetty looks <i>dreadfully!</i>” broke out May at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the garden gate. “She is worked and worried to
death! I am amazed that Mrs. Wayt allows it.
To reduce a girl like that to the level of a household
drudge is barbarous. She has no time for
society or recreation of any kind. It is toil, toil,
toil, from morning until night. Mary Ann—the
cook mamma got for them—says she ‘never saw
such another young lady for sweetness and kindness
to servants as Miss Hetty,’ but that she
‘carries all the house on them straight little shoulders
of hern.’ Hester tells the same story in better
English.”</p>

<p>She repeated what she had heard that evening.</p>

<p>March stopped to listen under the king apple
tree, where he had begun to love the subject of
the eulogy. While May declaimed he reached
up for a cluster of green apples and leaves and
pulled it to pieces, his face grave, his fingers
lingering.</p>

<p>“Heaven knows, May”—she was not prepared
for the emotion with which it was uttered—“that
I would risk my life to make hers happy. I
hoped once—but you see for yourself how she
avoids me. I could fancy sometimes that she is
afraid of me!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is afraid of herself.”</p>

<p>He looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>“Is that a chance remark? You women understand
one another. Have you seen anything——”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing I could or would repeat, my dear
boy! But there is a mystery somewhere, and I
can’t believe it is the phenomenon of such a sensible
girl’s failure to appreciate my brother. May
I say something, March, dear?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you like—after what has gone before!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it ought not to have gone before—or
after, either. For, brother, this is not just the
sort of connection that you should form. To
speak plainly, you might look higher. ‘Strike—but
hear!’ Hetty is all that I have said, and
more. But there is a Bohemian flavor about the
household. We will whisper it—even at half-past
ten o’clock at night, in the orchard—and
never hint it to ‘the people,’ or to mamma! They
are nomads from first to last—why, I cannot say.
They have lived everywhere, and nowhere long.
Mrs. Wayt is a refined gentlewoman, but her eyes
are sad and anxious. You know how fond I am
of Hester, poor child! Still a nameless something
clings to them as a whole—not quite a
taint, but a tang! Especially to Mr. Wayt.
There! it is out! Let us hope the apple trees
are discreet! I distrust him, March! He doesn’t
ring true. He is always on pose. He is a sanctimonious
(which doesn’t mean sanctified) self-lover.
Such men ought to remain celibate.”</p>

<p>March tried to laugh, but not successfully.</p>

<p>“I dissent from and agree to nothing you say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
But——” He waited so long that May finished
the sentence for him.</p>

<p>“But you love Hetty?”</p>

<p>“Yes! She <i>suits</i> me, May! As no other
woman ever did. As no other woman ever will.
I have tried to reason myself out of the persuasion,
but get deeper in. She <i>suits</i> me—every fiber
and every impulse of my nature. I seem to have
known her forever and always to have missed
her.”</p>

<p>With all her pride in her family and ambition
for her brother May had a romantic side to her
character. Had she liked Hetty less, she would
yet have pledged her support to the lover. She
told him this while they strolled homeward, and
then around and around the graveled drive in front
of the Gilchrist portico, and had, in return, the
full story of his passion.</p>

<p>“When I marry, my wife will have all there is
of me,” he had said, long ago, to his sister.</p>

<p>He reminded her of it to-night.</p>

<p>“She is not a brilliant society woman. Not
beautiful, perhaps. I am not a competent judge
of that at this date. She has not the prestige of
wealth or station. But she is my counterpart.”</p>

<p>He always returned to that.</p>

<p>When his sister had gone into the house he
tarried on the lawn with his cigar. What freshness
the fierce sun had left to the air was all to
be found out of doors. As the gray swathes continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to smother the light out of the moon the
heat became more oppressive. The gravel walks
were hot to his feet; the bricks of the house
radiated caloric. With a half-laugh at the whim,
he entered the now silent and darkened dwelling,
sought and procured a carriage rug, and pulling
the door shut after him, whistled for Thor, and
retraced his steps to the orchard. He spread the
rug upon the grass kept cool by the down-leaning
branches of the arbor and cast himself upon it.
He meant to make a night of it.</p>

<p>“I have camped out, many a July night, in far
less luxurious quarters,” he muttered. “And this
place is sacred.”</p>

<p>When the mosquitoes began to hum in his ears,
he lighted another cigar. He was the more glad
to do it, as he fancied, once in a while, that the
young apples or the wilting leaves had a peculiar
and not pleasant odor, as of some gum or essence,
that hung long in the atmosphere. He had
noticed it when he pulled down a branch to get
the spray he had torn apart, while May talked.
The air was full of foreign scents to-night, and
this might be an olfactory imagination.</p>

<p>As twelve o’clock struck from the nearest
church spire, he was staring into the formless
shadows overhead and living over the apple-blossom
week, the symphony in pink and white. The
young robins were full fledged and had flitted
from the parent nest. The young hope, born of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
what stood with him for all the poetry of his six-and-twenty
years of life, spread strong wings toward
a future he was not to enjoy alone.</p>

<p>Thor was uneasy. He should have found his
share of the rug laid upon elastic turf as comfortable
as the mat on the piazza floor, which was
his usual bed, yet he arose to his haunches, once
and again, and, although at his master’s touch or
word, he lay down obediently, the outline of his
big head, as March could make it out in the
gloom, was alert.</p>

<p>“What is it, old boy?” said he presently.
“What is going on?”</p>

<p>Thor whined and beat the ground with his tail,
both tentatively, as asking information in return.</p>

<p>In raising his own head from the yielding and
soft rustling grasses, March became aware of a
sound, iterative and teasing, that vexed the languid
night. It was like the ticking of a clock, or
of an uncommonly strenuous deathwatch. While
he listened it seemed to gather force and become
rhythmic.</p>

<p>“Click! click! clack! click! click! <i>clack!</i>
clicketty click! clicketty, clicketty <i>clack!</i> click!
click! click! clicketty <i>clack!</i> ting!”</p>

<p>Somebody was working a typewriter on this
stifling night, presumably by artificial light, in the
most aristocratic quarter of Fairhill.</p>

<p>Thor knew the incident to be unprecedented.
The rhythmic iteration made his master nervous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the sharp warning of the bell at the end of
each line pierced his ear like the touch of a fine
wire.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked about him.</p>

<p>An aperture in the foliage let through a single
ray of light. It came from the direction of the
parsonage.</p>

<p>“Tony’s pet hallucination is of a wandering
light in the garden and orchard, a sort of ‘Will
o’ the Wisp’ affair, which it is his duty to look
after,” Hester had said that evening. “He rushes
downstairs at all hours of the evening to see who
is carrying it. I told him last night that burglars
were too clever to care to enter a clergyman’s
house, but he cannot be convinced that somebody,
bent upon mischief, doesn’t prowl about
the premises. He is half blind, you know, and
has but three-fourths of his wits within call.”</p>

<p>Recollecting this, March arose cautiously, whispered
to Thor to “trail,” and stole noiselessly up
the easy grade.</p>

<p>The light was in the wing of the parsonage and
shone from the wide window of the pastor’s study
on the first floor. The shutters were open; a
wire screen excluded insects, and just within this
sat a woman at a typewriter—Hetty!</p>

<p>Across the shallow garden he could see that
her hair was combed to the crown of her head for
coolness, and coiled loosely there. Now that he
was nearer to the house, he distinguished another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
voice, also a woman’s, dictating, or reading, as the
flying fingers manipulated the keys. Drawing
out his repeater, he struck it. Half-past twelve!</p>

<p>“I have been sorely interrupted in my pulpit
preparation this week,” Mr. Wayt had informed
Mrs. Gilchrist, on taking leave that night. “I
fear the sunlight will extinguish my midnight
argand burner. ‘The labor we delight in physicks
pain,’ and, with me, takes the place of slumber,
meat, and drink.”</p>

<p>Impressed by an undefined sense of trouble,
March stood, his hand upon the gate, almost
decided to go up to the house and inquire if
aught were amiss. While he cast about in his
mind for some form of words that might account
for his intrusion, Mrs. Wayt’s figure came forward,
and offered, with one hand, a glass of water to
her sister. In the other she held a paper. Without
taking her fingers from the typewriter Hetty
raised her head, Mrs. Wayt put the glass to her
lips, and, while she drank, dictated a sentence
from the sheet in her hand. In the breezeless
hush of the July night a clause was audible to the
spectator.</p>

<p>“Who has not heard the story of the drummer
boy of Gettysburg?”</p>

<p>“Click-click-clack! Click-click-clack!” recommenced
the noisy rattle.</p>

<p>While Hetty’s fingers flew her sister fanned
her gently, but the eyes of one were riveted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the machine, those of the other never left the
paper in her hand.</p>

<p>March went back to his orchard camp, Thor at
his heels.</p>

<p>It was close cloudy; the purple play of lightning
was whitening and concentrating in less frequent
lines and lances. When these came, it
could be seen that thunderheads were lifting
themselves in the west. But the night remained
windless, and the iterative click still teased the
ears of the watcher. It was an odd vigil, even
for an anxious lover, to lie there, gazing into the
black abysses of shade, seeing naught except by
livid flashes that left deeper blackness, and knowing
whose vital forces were expended in the unseasonable
toil.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Did the overladen girl
add copying for pay to the list of her labors?
And could the sister who seemed to love her, aid
and abet the suicidal work? Where was Mr.
Wayt? The play of questions took the measure
and beat of the type keys, until he was wild with
speculation and hearkening.</p>

<p>At half-past two the rattle ceased suddenly.
Almost beside himself with nervous restlessness,
he sprang up and looked through the gap in the
boughs. The light went out, and, at the same
instant, the delayed storm burst in roar and rain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>, July 5, dawned gloriously, clear
and fresh after the thunder-storm, to which Fairhill
people still refer pridefully, as the most violent
known in thirty years. The gunpowder and
Chinese paper taint was swept and washed out of
the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt, holding Fanny by the hand, and
followed decorously by the twin boys in their
Sunday clothes and churchward-bound behavior,
emerged from her gate as the Gilchrists gained it.
In the white light of the forenoon, the eyes of
the pastor’s wife showed faded; groups of fine
wrinkles were at the corners, and bistre shadows
under them. Yet she announced vivaciously
that all were in their usual health at home, except
for Mr. Wayt’s headache, and nobody had been
hurt yesterday.</p>

<p>“For which we should return special thanks,
public and private,” she went on to say, walking,
with her little girl, abreast with Judge and Mrs.
Gilchrist, the boys falling back with the young
people. “At least, those of us who are the
mothers of American boys. I can breathe with
tolerable freedom now until the next Fourth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
July. What a fearful storm we had last night!
My baby was awakened by it and wanted to
know if it was ‘torpetoes or firetrackers?’ Yet,
since we owe our beautiful Sabbath to the
thunder and rain, we may be thankful for it; as
for many other things that seem grievous in the
endurance.”</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Wayt’s headache is not in consequence
of having sat up until daybreak, as he
threatened to do,” the judge said, in a genial
voice that reached his son’s ears.</p>

<p>March listened breathlessly for the reply.</p>

<p>“I think not. I did not ask him this morning
at what time he left his study. He is not
inclined to be communicative with regard to his
sins of commission in that respect, but I suspect
he is an incorrigible offender. He attributes his
headache—verbally—to the extraordinary heat
of yesterday. We all suffered from it, more or
less, and it increased rather than diminished,
after sunset.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Wayt well enough to take the service
this morning?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” quickly emphatical. “It would be
a severe indisposition indeed that would keep him
out of the pulpit. Both his parents suffered
intensely from nervous and sick headaches, so he
could hardly hope to escape. I have observed
that people who are subject to constitutional
attacks of this kind, are seldom ill in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
way, particularly if the headaches are hereditary.
How do you account for this, Judge Gilchrist?
Or, perhaps, you doubt the statement itself.”</p>

<p>March did not trouble his brains with his
father’s reply. The volubility of one whose discourse
was generally distinctively refined and
moderate in tone and terms would of itself have
challenged attention. But what was her object
in saying that she had not inquired at what hour
her husband left his study last night? Since
she and her sister were in occupation of the room
from midnight—probably before that hour—until
two in the morning, she certainly knew that he
was not there and almost as surely where he was
and how engaged during those hours. Where
was the need of duplicity in the circumstances?
Was she committed to uphold the professional
fiction, which her husband circulated vauntingly,
that his best pulpit preparation must be done
when honest people are asleep in their beds—that
the beaten oil of the sanctuary must flow through
lamp-wick or gas-burners? What end was subserved
by supererogatory diplomacy and subterfuge?</p>

<p>“How are the two Hesters to-day, Mrs. Wayt?”
asked May, from the side of her puzzled brother.</p>

<p>“Hester is rather languid. The heat again!”</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder to say it, and
they could see how entirely the freshness had
gone from eyes and complexion. Her very hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
looked bleached and dry. “The weather will
excuse every mishap and misdemeanor until the
dog days are over. Hetty stayed at home to
watch over her. It is a source of regret to Mr.
Wayt and myself”—comprehensively to the four
Gilchrists—“that my sister is so often debarred
the privileges of the sanctuary in consequence of
Hester’s dependence upon her.”</p>

<p>“I have remarked that she is frequently absent
from church,” Mrs. Gilchrist answered.</p>

<p>Her dry tone annoyed her son. Yet how could
she, bred in luxury and living in affluence, enter
into the exigencies of a position which combined
the offices of nurse, companion, housewife, seamstress,
mother, and bread-winner?</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt took alarm.</p>

<p>“Poor child! she hardly calls herself a church-goer
at all. But it is not her fault. She thinks,
and with reason, that it is more important for me
to attend service regularly—for the sake of the
example, you understand—and we cannot leave
our dear, helpless child with the children or servants.
She gets no Sabbath except as my sister
gives it to her. I am anxious that the true state
of the case should be understood by the church
people. Hetty would grieve to think that her
enforced absences are a stumbling block.”</p>

<p>Her solicitude was genuine and obvious. Judge
Gilchrist offered an assuasive:</p>

<p>“We must have a telephone wire run from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
pulpit to Miss Hester’s room. I have known of
such things.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that Hester would care to keep
her room Sunday mornings then!” whispered
Perry, <i>l’enfant terrible</i> of the Wayt family. “She
says family prayers are all she can stand.”</p>

<p>March, the recipient of the saucy “aside,” cast
a warning look at the telltale. Inwardly he was
amused by the unlucky revelation. Spoiled child
as Hester was, she had marvelously keen perceptions
and shrewd judgment. She saw through
the jugglery that deceived the mass of Mr. Wayt’s
followers, and rated correctly the worth of his
capital.</p>

<p>He juggled rarely to-day. Even his voice partook
of the spread-eagle element which interfused
Divine services as conducted by the popular
preacher. The church was full to the doors,
many of the audience being strangers and sightseers.
The number of “transients” increased
weekly.</p>

<p>“He is like fly-paper,” Hester had said, this
very Sunday, as the skirts of his well-fitting coat,
clerically cut and closely buttoned, cleared the
front door. “Out of the many that swarm and
buzz about him, some are sure to stick—that is,
take pews! That is the test of spiritual husbandry,
Hetty! I believe I’ll be an infidel!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be utterly absurd!” answered her aunt
in a spiritless way. “I haven’t the energy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
argue, or even scold. ‘Let God be true, and
every man a liar.’ God forgive me, but I am
ready, sometimes, to say that all men <i>are!</i> But
I can’t let Him go, dear!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt gave out the opening hymn in tones
that would have been clarion, but for an occasional
break into falsetto that brought to March’s
irreverent mind the wheezing drone of a bagpipe.</p>

<p>His text was, as was his custom, startlingly
peculiar:</p>

<p>“<i>Only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</i>”</p>

<p>It was a political discourse, after the manner of
a majority of discourses which are miscalled
“National.” Government jobbery, nepotism, and
chicanery; close corporations, railway monopolies,
municipal contracts—each had its castigation;
at each was hurled the prophecy of the day
of doom when head and palms would be sundered
from the fishy trunk, and evil in every form be
dominated by God’s truth marching on.</p>

<p>March listened for a while, then reverted to
matters of more nearly personal interest. Last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
night’s incident had left a most disagreeable impression
on his mind, which was confirmed by
Mrs. Wayt’s demeanor. May’s assertion of the
Bohemian flavor recurred to him more than once.
No! the specious advocate of public reforms and
private probity did not “ring true.” And protest
as Hester might, with all the passion of a forceful
nature, against her father’s double ways, he <i>was</i>
her father, and the ruler of his household. His
wife, it was plain, believed in and imitated him.</p>

<p>Gazing at the pale, large-featured face of the
orator, now alive with his theme, and glancing
from this to the refined, faded lineaments of her
whose meek eyes were raised to it from the pastor’s
pew, he was distrustful of both. He wished
Hetty were not Mr. Wayt’s wife’s sister, or that
he could marry her out of hand, and get his
brother-in-law, once removed, a call to—Alaska!
Her, he never doubted. Their acquaintance had
been brief, and scanty opportunities of improving
it had been vouchsafed to him of late; yet she
had fastened herself too firmly upon affection and
esteem to admit of the approach of disparaging
suspicion. She might be a slave to her sister and
her sister’s children. She could never be made a
tool for the furtherance of unworthy ends. <i>She</i>
would not have said: “I did not inquire at what
hour Mr. Wayt left his study last night!” If she
spoke, it would be to tell the truth.</p>

<p>At this point an idea entered his brain, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a flood of light with it. Mrs. Wayt was an
author—one of the many ministers’ wives who
eke out insufficient salaries by writing for Sunday-school
and church papers! It was a matter of
moment—perhaps of ten dollars—to get off a
MS. by a given time, and Hetty had taken it
down in typewriting from her dictation and the
rough draught. Of a certainty, here was the
solution of the mysterious vigil, and of Mrs.
Wayt’s equivocation! She looked like a woman
who would write over the signature of “Aunt
Huldah” in the Children’s Column, or “Theresa
Trefoil” in the Woman’s Work-table, and dread
lest her identity with these worthies should be
suspected by her husband’s people, or by even
“dear Percy” himself.</p>

<p>March experienced a blessed letting-down of
the whole system—a surcease from worrying
thought, so sudden that a deep sigh escaped him
that made his mother glance askance at him.
Instead of admiring the brave industry of the true
wife he had suffered a whimsical prejudice to
poison his mind against her. He despised himself
as a midnight spy and gossip hunter, in the
recollection of the orchard vigil. The patient,
unseasonable toil of the sisters became sublime.</p>

<p>“<i>Who has not heard the story of the drummer
boy of Gettysburg?</i>” thundered the preacher,
raising eagle eyes from the manuscript laid between
the Bible leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>March jumped as if the fulmination were chain-shot.
Mrs. Gilchrist, looking full at him, saw his
color flicker violently, his fingers clinch hard upon
the palms. Then he became so ghastly that she
whispered:</p>

<p>“Are you ill?”</p>

<p>“A sharp pain in my side! It will be gone in
a moment,” he whispered back, his lips contracting
into a smile. Rather a sword in his heart.
The light within him was darkness. How foolish
not to have solved the mean riddle at a glance!
Mr. Wayt’s sensational sermons were composed
by his clever wife, and transcribed by her as clever
sister! Here was the secret of the sense of unreality
and distrust that had haunted him in this
man’s presence from the beginning of their
acquaintanceship. The specious divine was a
fraud out and out, and through and through a
cheap cheat. No wonder now, at the swift itinerancy
of his ministry! His talk of midnight study
was a lie, his pretense of scholarship a trick so
flimsy that a child should have seen through it.
He had gone to bed the evening before, and
taken his rest in sleep, while his accomplices got
up to order the patriotic pyrotechnics for the
next day.</p>

<p>No wonder that Mrs. Wayt’s eyes were furtive
and anxious, that there were crow’s feet in the
corners, and bistre rings about them after that
July night’s work!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder that the less hardened and less
culpable sister-in-law shunned church services!</p>

<p>The sword was double-edged, and dug and
turned in his heart. For the girl who lent aid,
willing or reluctant, to the deliberate deception
practiced in the Name which is above all other
names, had a face as clear as the sun, and eyes
honest as Heaven, and he loved her!</p>

<p>The main body of the audience could not withdraw
their eyes from the narrator of the telling
anecdote of the drummer-boy of Gettysburg.
The story was new to all there, although he had
assumed their familiarity with it. It was graphic;
it was pathetic to heart-break; it thrilled and
glowed and coruscated with self-devotion and
patriotism; it was an inimitable illustration of the
point just made by the orator, who was carried
clear out of himself by the theme. And not one
person there—not even March Gilchrist, fiercely
distrustful of the man and all his works—suspected
that it was an original incident, home-grown,
homespun, and home-woven. Write it not
down as a sin against the popular pastor of the
Fairhill First Church that the Gettysburg hero
was a twenty-four-year-old child of the speaker’s
brain. If the Mill of the Press, and the Foundry
of Tradition cannot turn out illustrations numerous
and pat enough to suit every subject and
time, private enterprise must supply personal
demand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think young Gilchrist was ill in church to-day,”
observed Mr. Wayt to his wife that afternoon,
as she fed him with the dainty repast he
could not go to the table to eat.</p>

<p>He lay on the settee in the wide, cool hall,
supported by linen-covered cushions. She had
brought him, as a persuasive first course, a cup of
delicious bouillon, ice-cold, and administered it to
him, spoonful by spoonful.</p>

<p>“He changed color, and seemed to be in great
pain for an instant,” he continued, after another
sip. “His mother looked very uneasy, and apparently
advised him to go out. I judged from
his fluctuations of color that it was vertigo—or a
severe pain in the head. He would not leave
until the services were over. I have few more
attentive hearers than March.” Another sip.
“If I should be the means of bringing him into
the Church, it would be a happy day for his pious
mother. Should my headache abate in the course
of an hour or so, I will look in and inquire how
he is. It would only be courteous and neighborly.”</p>

<p>In the adjoining dining room, the door of which
the draught had opened a few inches, the family
circle of the solicitous pastor heard every word of
the communication, although his accents were
subdued by pain.</p>

<p>Sharp-eared-and-eyed Perry winked at Hetty.</p>

<p>“He won’t find Mr. March Gilchrist,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mouthed in a fashion invented by himself, to convey
pert speeches only to the person for whom
they were invented. “He went to New York on
the five o’clock train. I saw him. He said he
was going to dine with a friend. I heard him. A
man asked him. Another slice of beef, please,
Hetty! Rare, and a bit of fat! Some gravy on
my potatoes, too!”</p>

<p>Hetty had shunned the orchard since the day
of the last sitting. Seated behind the shutters of
her chamber-window, she had seen, almost every
day, Thor bound across the grass in pursuit of a
figure partially hidden by the lower branches.
Since March frequented the spot, it was no resort
for her. She had no time for play, she told
Hester, gently, when she pleaded for a return to
the pleasant lounging and talk “under green-apple
boughs.” Homer could draw the carriage
down the garden-walk and through the gate and
leave the cripple there with books and color
box, whenever she wanted to go. Hester often
brought back stories of chats and readings and
painting lessons with the brother or sister—sometimes
with both. Occasionally, March came to
the parsonage with a message from his sister to
the effect that she had taken Hester home with
her for the day or evening, and would return her
in good order. He was apt to insist upon leaving
the message with Hetty, if Mary Ann or one
of the children answered his ring. Mr. Wayt’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
wife’s sister would obey the summons in person,
but she did not invite the bearer in.</p>

<p>She ran down in her simple morning gown, or
almost as plain afternoon dress, without waiting
to remove her sewing apron, heard what he had
to say gravely, and replied civilly, as might a servant
or governess. And day by day, he marked
the lessening round of cheek and chin, and the
deepening of the plait between the brows. She
could not know that he went away, each time
pitying and loving her the more, and furious at
the cruelty of the demands upon her time and
strength. She could not have altered her
behavior, unless to grow more formal, had she
divined all.</p>

<p>But for the orchard outings Hester would have
had but a dull summer of it. As it was, it was
the happiest of her life. She actually gained
flesh, and her cheeks had the delicate flush of a
sweet-pea blossom. She mellowed and mollified
in the intercourse with the sound, bright natures
of her new friends. Prosperity was teaching her
unselfishness.</p>

<p>Hetty had a proof of this after the Sunday
dinner was eaten, and there still remained a long
hour of sunful daylight.</p>

<p>“I have a charming book which Miss May lent
me yesterday,” she said, as her custodian inquired
what she should do for her entertainment. “And
now that mamma has set the children to studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
their Sunday-school lessons for next week,
you ought to have a breathing spell, my poor
dear. You are bleaching too fast to please me.
You can’t plead ‘work to do’ for once.”</p>

<p>Hetty yielded—the more, it would seem, because
she had not the strength to resist love
pleadings than from any desire for the “outing”
recommended by Hester. Taking shawl and
cushion with her, she passed down the garden
alley to the gate. There was a broad track
through the orchard, worn by the wheeled chair
and Hester’s attendants. It led straight to the
king apple tree. From this bourne another track,
not so distinctly marked, diverged to the white
picket fence shutting in the Gilchrist garden.
Hetty’s feet had never trodden this, she reflected
with a pang, after she had settled herself against
the brown trunk. It was most probable that she
never would.</p>

<p>Her one little dream was dead, and she was
too practical a business woman to resuscitate it.
Her consistent plan of avoiding March Gilchrist
and abjuring the painful sweet of association with
his sister was adopted before she returned to the
house from her ineffectual quest for Homer and
the parsley. She was filled with wonder, in looking
back to the time—was it three minutes, or
thirty?—she had wasted, leaning on the gate,
enveloped in lilac perfume as in a viewless mantle,
and daring to feel as other and unexceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
girls feel—that she could have forgotten herself
so utterly. <i>She</i> said—“so shamelessly.”</p>

<p>“The worm on the earth may look up to the
star,” if it fancies that method of spending an
ignoble life, but star-gazing and presumptuous
longing for a million centuries would bring planets
and worms no nearer together. Hetty was very
humble in imagining the figure. Some people
must live on the shady side of the street, where
rents are low, and green mold gathers upon
stones, and snails crawl in areas. If the wretches
who pune and pale in the malaria-breeding damps
would not go mad, they must not look too often
across the way where flowers and people bloom.
If they do, they must support the consequences.</p>

<p>This misguided girl had looked. She was now
suffering. That she merited what she had to
bear did not make the pain less.</p>

<p>Unwittingly she had spread her shawl where
March had laid his rug last night. The rough
bark of the tree-bole hurt her presently. Her
gown was thin, and her flesh less firm than it had
been six weeks ago. She slid down upon the
shawl, her head on the cushion, and reached out,
in idle misery, to pick up some withered leaves
and small, unripe apples scattered on the grass.
March had dropped them while hearkening to
his sister’s criticism of the Bohemian household.
She was as idly—and as miserably—tearing apart
the leaves toughened by the heat of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
when she heard a joyous rush behind her and
felt the panting of hot breath upon her neck, and
Thor was kissing her face and licking her hands.
She sprang to her feet and cast a wild glance
along the path and under the trees. There was
no one in sight. The grounds were peremptorily
posted, and no vagrant foot ever crossed them.
She took in the situation at once. March had
gone to New York in the five o’clock train; the
dog, wandering aimlessly about and missing his
master, had espied her, and accepted her as a substitute.
She knelt down and clasped her arms
about his head, laid her cheek to his burly
muzzle.</p>

<p>“O Thor! Thor! you would help me if you
could.” Just as she had fondled him in those
far-away, blissful days. Her hand was tangled in
his coat when, looking across his huge bulk, she
had met March Gilchrist’s eyes. True eyes—and
bonny and true, which must never read her soul
again.</p>

<p>“Thor! dear Thor!” She cried it out in a passion
of tears.</p>

<p>The faithful fellow moaned a little in sympathy.
The more eloquent than human longing to comfort
the sorrowing, never seen except in a dog’s
eyes, filled and rounded his.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t cry if I could help it, dear,” said
Hetty, her arch smile striking through the rain.
“And nobody else should see me shed a tear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
You are my only confidant; and I do believe
you understand—a little.”</p>

<p>He was not an indifferent consoler, it appeared,
for in fifteen minutes both of them were asleep,
their heads upon the same pillow.</p>

<p>The sunset sea breeze rustled the stooping
boughs. Arrows of greenish gold, tipped with
fire, were shot at random between the leaves at
the sleeping pair. Hetty was very pale, but the
grieving droop of the facial lines, the slight fullness
of the lower lip, and the slow curve of the
arm thrown above her head made her seem like
a child. She looked what she was, fairly tired
out—weariness so intense that it would have
chased slumber from the eyelids of an older
sufferer. She had cried herself to sleep, Thor’s
presence giving the sense of protecting companionship
the child feels in his mother’s nearness.
The cool breath of the approaching twilight, the
grateful shade, and Sabbath stillness did the rest.</p>

<p>Now and then a long, broken sigh heaved her
chest, and ran through her body. There was the
glisten of tiny crystals upon her eyelashes. Once
she sobbed aloud, and Thor moved uneasily and
sighed sympathetically. By and by he began to
beat his tail gently against the turf, his beautiful
eyes gleamed glad and wistful, but he did not
offer to lift his head. Hetty patted it in her
sleep, and left her hand there.</p>

<p>She and Thor were walking over a wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
prairie. The coarse grass flaunted up to her chin,
and she would have lost the dog had she not
wound her fingers in his hair. Such a long, tiresome,
toilsome way it was, and the grass so stiff
and strong! Sometimes it knotted about her
ankles; sometimes the beards struck like whips
across her face. A bitter wind was blowing, and
stung her eyes to watering. In passing it lashed
the grass into surges that boomed like the sea.</p>

<p>Miles and miles away an orange sunset burned
luridly upon the horizon, and right between her
and it was a floating figure, moving majestically
onward. A mantle blew back in the bitter wind
until she could almost touch the hem; a confusing
flutter of drapery masked the head and
shoulders; the face was set steadfastly westward
and kept away from her. At long intervals a
hand was tossed clear of the white foldings and
beckoned her to follow.</p>

<p>“And follow I will!” she said, between her set
teeth, to herself and to Thor, “I will follow until
I overtake him or die!”</p>

<p>And all the while the blasting wind hissed in
her hair and howled in the pampas grasses, and
her feet were sore and bleeding; her limbs failed
under her; her tongue clave to the roof of her
mouth with dryness; her heart beat faint——</p>

<p>Hark! At the upward fling of her leader’s arm
music rained down from heaven, and the earth
made joyous response; strong, exultant strains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
like an organ peal, and such vibrant melodious
chimes as Bunyan heard when all the bells of the
holy city rang together for joy. The majestic,
floating figure turned to lean toward her with
outstretched arms, and eyes that gazed into hers
as she had vowed they should never look again.</p>

<p>“Oh! I knew it must be you!” She said it
aloud, in her rapturous dream. “It could be
nobody else! Thank God! Thank God!”</p>

<p>Thor bounded from under her hand....</p>

<p>March Gilchrist’s New York friend was a
bachelor cousin, who was always delighted to
have “a good fellow” drop in upon him on Sunday
evening. March, in the uneasy wretchedness
that beset him, honestly intended to visit him
when he took the five o’clock train. He wanted
to get away from the place for a few hours, he
said; away from tormenting associations and possible
catechists, and think calmly of the next step
to be taken. By the time he reached Jersey City
he had discovered that he was trying to get away
from himself and not from his home; moreover,
that he wanted neither dinner nor the society of
the genial celibate. He stepped from the train,
turned into the station restaurant, sat down at the
table he had occupied on the day he landed from
the <i>City of Rome</i> and missed the noon train, and
ordered at random something to eat.</p>

<p>The long table built in the middle of the room
was surrounded by a party of men and women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
The men wore full black beards and a great deal
of waistcoat, crossed by gold ropes. The women
had round, black eyes, high-bridged noses and
pronounced complexions. March tried not to see
them, and tried to eat what was set before him.
It made him sick to observe that Hetty’s place
was filled by an overblown young lady whose
bang made a definite downward peak between
her black brows, and who had ten rings on the
left hand and five on the right.</p>

<p>He caught the 6.30 train back to Fairhill. He
had made up his sensible mind to talk over his
family to a project marvelously well developed
when one remembers that the inception was not
an hour old when he swung himself off upon the
platform of the Fairhill station. He would set
out next week for the Adirondacks, set up a forest
studio, and begin “serious work.” The phrase
jumped with his mood. Nothing else would
draw the inflammation out of the wound. He
meant to bear up like a man under the blow he
had received, to forget disappointment in labor
for a worthy end; love, in ambition.</p>

<p>He took the orchard in his walk home from the
station. It was quite out of his way, and he was
not guilty of the weakness of denying this. He
went there deliberately and with purpose, vaulting
the fence from the quiet street at the foot of
the hill, as he had done on that memorable Sunday
when the orchards were “all a-flutter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
pink.” One more look at the nook under green
apple-boughs would be a sad satisfaction, and the
contrast between what he had hoped and what he
knew to be rock-bottomed reality, would be a
salutary tonic. One look he must have—a look
that should be farewell to folly and regret.</p>

<p>While still twenty yards away from the arbor
he espied something that looked like a mass of
white drapery lying upon the turf. He stood just
without the drooping boughs fencing the sleeper
about, his face framed in an opening of the foliage,
as Hetty, aroused by Thor’s bound from her side,
raised her eyelids and closed them again with a
smile of dreamy delight upon eyes swimming in
luminous tears.</p>

<p>“I thought it was you!” she repeated in a
thrilling whisper, and again, and more drowsily—“Thank
God!”</p>

<p>The church bells, chiming the half-hour notice
of evening service, went on with the music of her
dream.</p>

<p>Thor, enacting a second time the role of <i>Deus
ex machina</i>, thought this an auspicious moment
for thrusting his cold nose against her cheek.</p>

<p>With a stifled scream she attempted to rise, and
catching her foot in the shawl, would have fallen
had not March rushed forward to her help.
Having taken her hands to restore her to her balance,
he continued to hold them.</p>

<p>She struggled to free them—but feebly. Surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and confusion had robbed her of strength
and self-possession.</p>

<p>“I thought—they said—that is, Perry saw you
take the train for New York,” she managed to
articulate.</p>

<p>“Hetty!”—imploringly, while the eyes she had
seen in her vision overflowed hers with loving
light—“why do you shun me so persistently?
Are you determined never to hear how dear you
are to me?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span>, then, was the outcome of March Gilchrist’s
iron-clad resolve to forget in serious work one who
could never make him or his family happy!</p>

<p>Verily, the ways and variations of a man in love
are past finding out by ordinary means and everyday
reasoning. Our sensible swain could only
plead with his sister in defense of his fast grown
passion, that the girl “suited him.” Having decided
within eight hours that no alliance could be
more unsuitable than one with Mr. Wayt’s wife’s
sister, he had cast himself headforemost into the
thick of impassioned declaration of a devotion
the many waters of doubt could not drown, or
the fires of opposition destroy.</p>

<p>Dizzied and overwhelmed as she was by his
vehemence, Hetty was the first to regain the firm
ground of reason. He had seated her, with gentle
respect, upon the cushion that had pillowed her
head, and dropping on one knee, the “true, bonny
eyes” alight with eagerness, poured out the story
whose outlines we know. Earnestness took the
tinge of happiness as he was suffered to proceed;
the deep tones shook under the weight of emotion.
Not until she made a resolute effort to disengage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
her hands, and he saw the burning blushes
fade into dusky pallor and her eyes grow set and
troubled, did his heart begin to sink. Then the
gallant, knightly soul forbore importunity that
might be persecution. If his suit distressed her
for any cause whatsoever, he would await her disposition
to hearken to the rest.</p>

<p>Releasing her, he arose and stood a little space
away, respectfully attending upon her pleasure.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to impose all this upon reluctant
ears,” he said, when she did not speak.
Her face was averted, her hands pressed hard
together. The rust-brown bandeaux, ruffled by
the pressure of her head upon the pillow, gleamed
in the dying sunlight like a nimbus. The slight,
girlish figure was not a Madonna’s. It might be
a Mary at the tomb in Bethany before the “Come
forth!” was spoken.</p>

<p>“A word from you will send me away,” continued
March, with manly dignity, “if you wish
to dismiss me and the subject forever. I cannot
stop loving you, but I can promise not to annoy
you by telling you of a love you cannot receive.”</p>

<p>“Annoy me!” repeated the poor, stiff lips.
“<i>Annoy</i> me! You must surely know, Mr. Gilchrist,
that <i>that</i> is not a word to be used by you
to me!”</p>

<p>“No?” coming a step nearer, eye kindling and
voice softening. “You will let me try to overcome
<i>indifference</i>, then—will you not?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>In the depth of her distress she appreciated
the adroit twist he gave her answer. The corners
of the pale mouth stirred. Her strength was
slipping from her. She must be brief and
decisive.</p>

<p>“If that were all”—looking courageously into
the glowing eyes—“I would give a very different
answer from the one you must accept without
questioning. I know that I can never give any
other, unprepared though I was for what you
have said. There are reasons not immediately
connected with myself why I ought not to think
for a moment of—the matter you were speaking
of. You have paid me the greatest compliment
a man can offer a woman. But while my sister
and the children need me as they do now I must
not think of leaving them, and I see no prospect
of their needing me less for years and years to
come. My sister opened her house to me when
I was orphaned and homeless. I owe her more
than I could make you understand. She is
peculiarly dependent upon me. Hester could
not do without me. You have seen that. I cannot
bear to think how she would suffer if I were
to go away.”</p>

<p>In her desire to deal gently and fairly with him
she had made a concession fatal to the integrity
of her cause. He laid hold of it at once.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Wayt has a husband; the children have
a father. He is a man in the prime of life, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
talents are approved by the Church. He is popular,
and in the receipt of a good salary. Fairhill
will probably remain Hester’s home for many
years to come. If this is all that separates us—why,
my darling——”</p>

<p>The strangest expression flashed over her
face—a wild ecstasy of joy that gave place, the
next second, to anguish as wild. She put her
hands over the tell-tale face, and bent her forehead
upon her knees.</p>

<p>“Don’t! oh, don’t!” she moaned. “This is
too hard! too cruel! If you could only know
all, you would not urge me! I did not think you
could be so unkind!”</p>

<p>“Unkind? To <i>you</i>, Hetty?”</p>

<p>“No! no!” moved to tears by the hurt tone,
and hurrying over the words. “You could never
be <i>that</i> to anybody—much less—I cannot say
what I would!”</p>

<p>March knelt down by her, and raised her head
with tender authority she could not resist. He
wiped the tears from her face with his own handkerchief;
smiled down into the wet eyes. Loving
intimacy with his mother and sister had taught
him wondrously winsome ways.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, dear!” as he would address a
grieving child. “Sometime, when you are quite
willing to talk freely to me of this awful ‘all,’ I
will prove to you how chimerical it is. Until
then, nothing you can say or do can shake my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
purpose of making you my wife, in God’s own
good time. We were <i>made</i> for one another,
Hetty! I have known that this great while. I
am positive I could convince you of it, if you
would give me a chance.”</p>

<p>She arose nervously, her hands chafing one
another in an action that was like wringing them
in impatience or anguish.</p>

<p>“I must go, Mr. Gilchrist! It is wrong to
allow you to say all this. Then, too, Hester will
be uneasy and need me.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you and explain why you
have outstayed your time,” March suggested,
demurely. “We could not have a more sympathetic
confidante than Hester. And I must tell
somebody.”</p>

<p>She looked frightened.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to tell! There never can be.
Cannot you see? haven’t I convinced you of
this?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. Until you can lay your
hand upon your heart—the heart you and I know
to be so true to itself and to others—and say, with
the lips that cannot frame a lie—‘March Gilchrist,
I can never love you in <i>any</i> circumstances!’ I
shall not see this other ‘never’ <i>you</i> articulate so
fiercely. If you want to get rid of me instantly,
and for all time, look at me and say it now—<i>Hetty!</i>”</p>

<p>His lingering enunciation of the name she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
never thought beautiful before, would of itself
have deprived her of the power to obey. She
stood dumb, with drooping head and cheeks burning
red as the sunset, her figure half turned away,
a lovely study of maiden confusion, had the spectator
been cool enough to note artistic effects.</p>

<p>Chivalric compassion restrained all indication
of the triumph a lover must feel in such a position.</p>

<p>“I will not detain you, if you must go in,” he
said, in a voice that was gentlest music to her ear.
“Forgive me for keeping you so long. I know
how conscientious you are, and how necessary
you are to Hester. We understand one another.
I will be very patient, dear, and considerate of
those whose claims are older than mine. But
there is one relation that outranks all others in
the sight of God and man. That relation you
hold to me. Don’t interrupt me, love! Nothing
can alter the fact. Give me those!” as she
stooped blindly for shawl and cushion. “It is
my duty to relieve you of all burdens which you
will permit me to carry for you. You would
rather not have me go to the house with you?”
interpreting her gesture and look. “Only to the
gate, then? You see how reasonable I can be
when possibilities are demanded.”</p>

<p>He made a remark upon the agreeable change
in the weather within the last twenty-four hours,
and upon the sweet repose of the Sabbath after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the tumult of the National holiday, as they walked
on, side by side. At the gate he stayed her with
his frank, pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>“I have a confession I don’t mind making now.
At half-past twelve o’clock last night I stood on
this spot watching you. Thor and I were camping
out in the orchard. It was too hot to go into
the house. I heard a queer clicking, and saw a
light in this direction, and came to look after
Homer’s Jack-o’-lantern. Instead, I saw you at
the study window, busy—oh! how wickedly
busy—with the typewriter!”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, for the face into which he
smiled was bloodless, the eyes aghast. She made
a movement as if to grasp the shawl and pillow
and rush away—then her forehead fell upon the
hand that clutched at the pickets for steadiness.</p>

<p>“Are you angry?” pleaded March, amazed and
humble. “If I had not loved you, I should not
have been here. Was it an impertinent intrusion?”</p>

<p>“No! And I am not angry—only startled.”
Her complexion was still ashy, and her tongue
formed the syllables carefully. “I can understand
that you must have thought strange of what you
saw. But I am used to typewriting. I earned
fifty dollars”—with mingled pride and defiance
March thought engaging—“last winter by copying
law papers. And I told you—everybody
must know how poor we are.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know more than that, dearest!” laying his
hand over her cold fingers. “I surmised when I
saw Mrs. Wayt dictating to you, what it meant.”</p>

<p>She was all herself again. In defense of her
sister’s secret, as he imagined when she began to
speak, she rallied her best forces. Her speech
was grave, dignified, and direct.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you surmised. The truth
is that Mr. Wayt was taken suddenly ill last night.
His sermon must be ready by this morning.
There was not time to get a substitute. So my
sister found his notes. They were very full. She
read them aloud to me. Nobody else can make
them out. I copied the sermon with the machine
from her dictation. You will understand that we
would not like to have this spoken of. Good-evening!”</p>

<p>She was beyond reach in a moment, in another
beyond call.</p>

<p>March went back to the sylvan retreat that
may be regarded as the stage set for the principal
scenes of our story. Step and heart were light,
and the same might be said of a brain that
whirled like a feather in a gale. While he had
been loath to admit the gravity of the misgivings
that had embittered the slow hours between
11:30 <small>A. M.</small> and 7 o’clock <small>P. M.</small> of that eventful
Sunday, he was keenly alive to the rapture
of their removal. What a boorish bat he had
been to suffer a suspicion of the lofty rectitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of the noblest woman upon earth to
enter his mind! How altogether simple and
convincing was her explanation of what should
have been no mystery to any honorable man!
Yet he could not be ashamed, in the fullness of
his happiness. He called himself all the hard
names in his vocabulary with cheerful volubility,
and gloried in the lesson he had thus learned of
implicit trust in the girl he loved. No accumulation
of circumstantial evidence or even the witness
of the eye should ever call up another
shadow of a shade of doubt. Among other
occasions for thankfulness was the recollection
that he had not let a lisp of what he had seen
last night and suspected this morning, escape him
in conversation with his mother and sister. He
found himself tracing, with a fine sense of the
drollery of the conceit, the analogy between prostrate
Dagon, <i>sans</i> arms, legs, and head, and the suspicion
which had menaced the destruction of his
happiness. Mutilated, prone, and harmless, it
lay on the threshold of the temple of love and
truth, ugly rubbish to be thrust forever out of
sight.</p>

<p>He had hardly noticed, in the ecstasy of relief,
Hetty’s haste to be gone after she had explained
her nocturnal industry. He passed as lightly
over the incoherence that had replied to his
question when he could see her again.</p>

<p>“Give me time to think! Not for a day or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
two! Not until you hear from me!” she had said
just before reaching the gate.</p>

<p>He was shrewd enough to see how well taken
was his vantage ground. She had not demurred
at his stipulation. He was positive, in the
audacity of youth and passion, that she would
never utter the words he had dictated. The turf
under the tree was flattened by her reclining
form. He lay down upon it, his arms doubled
under his head for a pillow, Thor taking his place
beside him. The golden green changed into dull
ruddy light, this into purple ash, and this into
gray that was at first warm, then cold. The
second vesper bell had set the air to quivering
and sobbed musically into silence that embalmed
the memory of the music. Rapt in dreams, in
summer fragrance, and in tender dusks, the lover
lay until the stars twinkled through rifts in the
massed leaves. Now and then, the far-off roll of
an organ and the sweet hymning of accompanying
voices were borne across his reverie, as the
wanderer through the twilight of an August day
meets waves of warm, perfumed air, or currents
of balsamic odors floating from evergreen heights.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the moon showed the edge of
a coy cheek above the horizon hills, and shortly
thereafter March heard the click of the garden
gate. Instinctively he put out his hand to keep
Thor quiet, an unwarrantable idea that Hetty
might revisit the spot darting through his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The shuffling of feet over the sward quieted his
leaping heart. In another minute he distinguished
the outlines of a figure stealing across
the moonlit spaces separating black blotches of
shade. As it neared the covert he spoke quietly,
not to alarm the intruder.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Homer.”</p>

<p>“O Lord!” The three-quarter-witted wight
bounded a foot from the ground, then collapsed
into a shaking huddle.</p>

<p>“It is I—Mr. Gilchrist,” March hastened to
add. “I am sorry I frightened you.”</p>

<p>“Now—I was jes a-lookin’ fer a light I see
from the back porch down this ’ere way,” uttered
Homer, in an agitated drawl.</p>

<p>March could see the coarse fingers rubbing
against the backs of his hands, and a ray of light
touched the pendulous jaw.</p>

<p>“It was the match I struck to light a cigar I
smoked a while ago,” he said. “I dare say that
may account for the light you have seen at other
times.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, sir”—dubiously. “I been saw the
light lots o’ nights, when I aint spoke of it.
’Tain’t like er sergar. It’s like a lantern a-swinging
this er way”—swaying one hand—“I clumb
this tree one night, an’ sot thar till nigh mornin’,
a-waitin’ an’ a-watchin’ fer it ter come again.
There’s a man what tole me ’twas the devil
a-watchin’ out for <i>me</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am surprised you try to catch him. From
what I have heard, he is a slippery chap.”</p>

<p>“<i>No-ow</i>—I aint a-feerd on him fer myself.
<i>Now</i>, I’d be loath fer him to worry Miss Hetty.”</p>

<p>“You are a good fellow, Homer! A brave
fellow!” responded the listener, with sudden
energy. “When you do get on the track of the
light, let me know, and I’ll lend a hand to nab
the devil.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, sir! <i>Now</i>, I’ve been a-turnin’ over in
my mind what that man say to me. He’s a man
as ought to know what he’s talkin’ about. He
t’reatened me orful a couple o’ times, sence we
come to Fairhill. Sometimes I can’t sleep fer
thinkin’ ’bout it. ‘You stay outen that orchard!’
he say. ‘Ther’ war a man murdered thar onct,’
he tell me, ‘an’ the devil is a-lookin’ fer him. Ef
he come acrost you he’ll ketch you by a mistake,’
he say. But then, there’s Miss Hetty, you know,
Mr. Gilchris’!”</p>

<p>“What under heaven has she to do with your
man, or his devil, or the light? Who is the man
who threatened you? Does he live in Fairhill?”</p>

<p>Homer plucked at his lower lip and glanced
apprehensively around.</p>

<p>“I dunno!” he answered, in sullen evasion.
“I met him on the street one day. Two times I
come acrost him in the orchard. Onct he come
to the garding gate. That was the time he tell
me ’bout the murder an’ the devil.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is a cruel, rascally liar!” cried March
indignantly. “And you don’t know his name?
What is he like? Did you ever speak of this to
Miss Hetty?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. She got ’nough to fret her a’ready,
Miss Hetty has. I’m ’fraid for her ’bout the
man. <i>She</i> aint ’fraid o’ nothin’. ‘You do what I
tell you, Homer,’ sez she, ‘an’ I’ll stan’ between
you an’ harm,’ she say. But she aint know ’bout
the devil. Nor I aint heerd o’ the murder when
she tell me <i>that</i>. That mought make a dif’rence.”</p>

<p>“She is all right, all the same. She is always
right. Mind her, and you’re sure to be safe.
When did you last see this man who is so well
acquainted with the devil?”</p>

<p>An uneasy pause, during which Homer
cracked each one of the knuckle-joints in his left
hand.</p>

<p>“I dunno! I don’ jis reklec’! You won’t
mention him to Miss Hetty—nor to nobody—will
you please not, Mr. Gilchris’? He’s an orful
man! He’d get even with Miss Hetty, some way,
sure’s you born, Mr. Gilchris’? ‘Nurver you let
on a word to <i>her!</i>’ sez he to me—‘or ’twill be
the wustest day she ever see,’ he sez.”</p>

<p>“Why, this is outrageous!” ejaculated the
aroused listener. “Do you suppose I will allow
this sort of thing to go on? I insist upon knowing
who the wretch is! He’ll find himself behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
bars before he is a day older, if I get hold of
him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>”—resumed Homer, dazed and dull—“you’d
better not meddle nor make with him.
Me’n’ Miss Hetty, we could manage ’bout him,
but when he sot ’bout fetchin’ the devil in—that
aint a fa’r shake—<i>that</i> aint! I’ll say that much,
ef I die fer it—’taint by no means ‘fa’r nor
squar’!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” March laughed in vexed amusement.
“Did you ever know the devil to do the fair and
square thing? Or any of the devil’s men?
Why didn’t you set Mr. Wayt after your friend?
It’s his trade to fight Old Nick, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. So I been heerd tell. What’s
<i>that?</i>”</p>

<p>It was the sound of the gate-latch falling into
the socket, and firm quick footsteps.</p>

<p>“O Lord!” whispered Homer again. “Don’t
let on as I’ve been here!”</p>

<p>In a twinkling, he had gone up the tree like a
cat.</p>

<p>By the time March recognized the latest comer,
the rustling boughs were still. Thor growled
fiercely. His master advanced a step into the
moonlight.</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” to the dog. “Good-evening, Mr.
Wayt! The beauty of the night has tempted you
out, as well as myself.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Gilchrist!”—suave and stately as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
usual. “As you say, it is a glorious night. I
have been sitting for half an hour with your
respected parents. Seeing you change color suddenly
during the morning service, and missing
you from church this afternoon, I feared lest you
had been taken ill, and so went over to inquire.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gilchrist appeased my anxiety by saying
that yours was a passing indisposition. I was the
more solicitous because I have suffered all day
from the onslaught of my constitutional enemy,
‘the rash’ and crucial headache which my mother
gave me. It is more than malady. It is <i>affliction!</i>
requiring pagan fortitude and Christian
resignation. There is some occult connection
between it and the course of the natural sun in
the heavens. It seized me this morning with the
rising of the god of day and left me at the going
down of the same. Mrs. Wayt will have it that it
is the penalty for much study which, if not weariness
to the flesh, occasionally revenges itself in
neuralgic pangs. I know no fatigue while the
oracular rage of composition is upon me. Last
night it <i>possessed</i> me! I wrote the entire sermon
to which you listened this morning between the
hours of half-past nine Saturday night and four
o’clock this morning. In all that time I did not
leave my desk. The thunder-storm wrought
strange, glorious excitement in my brain. It was
as if seven thunders uttered their voices to the
ears of my spirit.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Wayt prodded holes in the turf
with his cane while speaking, holding it in his
right hand almost at arm’s length, in a straight
line from his body. His face showed chalky-white
in the moon rays, his brows and hair very
black; his eyes glittered, the smile upon his thin,
wide-lipped mouth was apparent in the clearing
radiance. He was disposed to be affably loquacious
to the heir of a rich parishioner, and the pastor’s
“influence with young men” was one of his
specialties. This important member of an important
class did not interrupt him, and the intent
expression of his figure—his back was to the
moon—was pleasantly provocative to continued
eloquence.</p>

<p>“The Sabbath has been superb—truly superb!”
resumed the orator, pulling out the cane after an
unusual artesian feat in jabbing it into the earth.
“I could think of nothing as I looked out at daybreak
upon the brightening face of nature but
Mrs. Barbauld’s ‘rose that’s newly washed by the
shower.’ My spirit put on wings to meet the
new morning. I said, aloud, in a sort of divine
transport: ‘This is the day the Lord hath made.
Let us rejoice and be glad in it!’”</p>

<p>“Do you ever preach extemporaneously, Mr.
Wayt?” asked March.</p>

<p>The sentence passed his lips almost unawares.
In his perplexity and disdain, he spoke at random.
He could not stand here all night, the victim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the modern Coleridge. He recollected, while the
flowing periods went over him, that the Rev.
Percy’s admirers likened him to the long-winded
poet. The girl of his heart <i>in esse</i> and of his
home <i>in posse</i> might be Mr. Wayt’s wife’s sister,
but Mr. Wayt himself was an imposing liar and
hypocrite, who disgraced the coat on his back.
The sooner she was removed from his house the
better. He credited poor Tony with more sense
than he was reputed to possess, in that he
doubted, inferentially, his employer’s powers as
an exorcist.</p>

<p>“Now and then, my dear sir, now and then!
But I long ago arrived at the conclusion that
natural fluency is a lure to indolence. Whatever
is worth the hearing should be worth careful preparation.
The <i>vice versa</i> occurs to you, of course.
I would give my audience ripe matter, the slow
accretion of amber-clear thought, not the fervid
exudation of momentary excitement. Every line
of this morning’s sermon was written out in full.
The reporter of a New York paper took it from
my hand as I descended from the pulpit. ‘Mr.
Wayt!’ he said, ‘that discourse can be printed
without the alteration of a word. It is perfect!’”</p>

<p>The man’s supreme egotism pushed March into
indiscretion, which he afterward considered dishonorable.</p>

<p>“You never use the typewriter, then?”</p>

<p>“Occasionally,” carelessly. “I might say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
semi-occasionally. But not when I am in the
Spirit—as I reverently believe I was last night.
Mrs. Wayt is a deft operator on it. She learned
expressly to copy my sermons and lectures for
the press. What will not a good wife do for her
husband?”</p>

<p>“What, indeed?” assented March fervently.</p>

<p>He was thinking of the wifely equivocations to
which he had hearkened on the way to church,
and, with genuine satisfaction, how straightforward
was Hetty’s simple tale of the sermon-writing
episode. Again he resolved to tear her
out of this web of needless deceits at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p>He left the vicinity of the apple tree, partly to
shake off his companion, partly to allow Homer
opportunity to escape. Once he had his lips
open to intimate his presence in the orchard at
midnight, and that he had seen the light in the
study. The reverend humbug should be warned
of the danger of gratuitous and wholesale lying.
He withheld the caution. It was not his province
to reprove a man so much his senior, and—he
added mentally—such an old offender.</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt sauntered on with him to the gate
opening into the Gilchrist shrubbery, bade him
“good-night,” and marched back. March leaned
upon the fence, seeming to stare at the moon,
and enjoying a nightcap cigar, until the long,
black figure entered the parsonage garden. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the young man lingered he saw Homer drop,
monkeylike, to the earth and skulk homeward,
keeping in the shadow when he could.</p>

<p>“I would sooner take the fool’s chances of
evading the devil than his pompous and pious
master’s!” soliloquized Mrs. Gilchrist’s son.</p>

<p>Hetty was dusting the big parlors next morning,
and making ineffectual attempts to evolve
coziness out of carpeted space, when a cough at
the door attracted her notice.</p>

<p>Homer stood there, military cap in hand, and
wet up to the knees with dew. His love for
flowers was a passion, only surpassed by his
exquisite tenderness for dumb animals and children.
Hetty had said of her <i>protégé</i> that he had
the soul of a painter-poet, but that the wires were
cut between spirit and speech. He had been on
his knees since there was light enough to show
the difference between weeds and precious plants,
cleaning out the garden borders.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>” (fumbling with his shabby headgear),
“I was wishful fer to speak with ye before ennybody
else came down. Leastways, Mary Ann,
she’s in the kitchen, but don’t count, bein’ busy
an’ out of the way.”</p>

<p>Hetty smiled languidly. Her eyes were heavy-lidded;
her motions slow for her. She had lain
all night, staring into the blackness above her,
now crying to a deaf heaven to show her a plain
path for her feet, now trembling with ecstatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
anguish in the recollection of the interview
that opened a vista of Eden she yet dared not
enter.</p>

<p>“Come what may, he has called me darling!”
she was thinking for the hundredth time, as the
interruption came.</p>

<p>“What is it, Homer? Are your flowers all
right?”</p>

<p>He ventured, after a glance at his feet, to step
upon the unbroken breadths of Brussels.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>—I was up a tree in the orchard las’
night. An’ Mr. Gilchris’—the <i>young</i> one—and
Mr. Wayt, they were a-talkin’ on the groun’ under
the tree——”</p>

<p>Hetty wheeled upon him with blazing eyes and
cheeks.</p>

<p>“You were in the orchard! In what tree?
When? But no!” Her excitement subsided as
quickly as it had arisen. “You were in the house
when I came in. Go on!” She drew a long
breath.</p>

<p>Homer twiddled his thumbs in the crown of
his cap. His speech could never be hurried. If
urged to talk fast, he was dumb.</p>

<p>“Now, I was up in that big tree where the picter
was painted. Mr. Gilchris’—the young Mr.
Gilchris’—he war a-lyin’ onto the grass when I
came along. ’Twar after you had gone upstairs—nigh
onto ten o’clock, I guess, or may be nine—I
aint certain. I’d saw the same light, an’, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
all them boys ken say, I’ve been saw it many a
time——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the light.” Hetty said it patiently.
“Tell me how you happened to climb
the tree.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Gilchris’—the young gentleman—he
spoke very civil an’ kind to me, an’ we war
talkin’ quite a spell, when I heerd Mr. Wayt
a-comin’, an’ I clumb the tree so’s he wouldn’t
see me, an’ may be go fur me, you know. An’
while I war in the tree I heerd him a-tellin’ Mr.
Gilchris’—I meantersay the young Mr. Gilchris’—how
he’d sot up ’tell daybreak, four o’clock Sat’day
night, a figurin’ onto his sermon what he
preached on Sunday——”</p>

<p>“Homer!”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am! He war talkin’ very high
Scotch, mos’ly like he does all times, ’specially to
comp’ny-folks, but I got the sense of that much.
He said as how he an’ the thunder-storm they
figured up the sermon together, near’s I could
make out. An’ Mr. Gilchris’—the young gentleman—he
said precious little—an’ Mr. Wayt, he
splurged out considerable ’bout seein’ the sun rise
an’ so forth, an’ ’bout his headache comin’ on an’
a-goin off with the sun. An’ then the two of
’em walked off quite frien’ly, an’ soon’s as they
was out o’ sight, I lighted out and come home.”</p>

<p>Hetty was sitting upon the sofa, too sick and
weak to stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you sure that you heard all this? Did
Mr. Gilchrist know you were in the tree?”</p>

<p>“Now—he see me go up. I ast him not to let
on to <i>him</i>. But what I come to say war, ’taint
noways nor nurver safe to say what aint jes’ true,
jes’ for the sake of talkin’ big, an’ Mr. Wayt, bein’
a edicated man, he’d ought to be tole that.
T’ould ’a’ been better not to say nuthin’ ’bout
Sat’day night ’thout somebody ast h’m.”</p>

<p>“There!” His young mistress put out her
hand imperatively. “That will do. Don’t speak
of this to anybody else. Go back to your work.”</p>

<p>On their way to school, the twins left a thin
envelope at Judge Gilchrist’s door. It was
addressed to March.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have heard what was the substance of Mr.
Wayt’s conversation with you last night. Knowing

reasons why I can never be more than</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">March Gilchrist’s</span> name was brought up to
the sewing room at eleven o’clock Monday morning.
Hetty was cutting out shirts for the twins
at a table of Homer’s contrivance and manufacture.
Her face was flushed, perhaps with stooping
over the board, when she looked up.</p>

<p>“Please say that I am particularly engaged this
morning, Mary Ann, and beg to be excused.”</p>

<p>“My dear!” expostulated Mrs. Wayt. “He
has probably called with a message from his
mother or sister.”</p>

<p>“In that case ask him to leave it with you,
Mary Ann, unless you care to go down, Frances?”</p>

<p>“He said ‘Miss Alling’ most particular,” ventured
Mary Ann.</p>

<p>“Then take my message just as I gave it, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“Did you know,” pursued Miss Alling, when
the girl had gone, “that Perry is an inch taller
than his brother? His arms are longer, too.
They were exactly the same size until this summer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt eyed her sister with a helpless,
distraught air, while the scissors flashed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
slipped through the muslin, and the worker appeared
to have no interest in life beyond the
manipulation of both.</p>

<p>“Dear,” she said timidly at length, without
noticing the other’s query. “I never blame you
for any action, however singular it may seem to
me. I know you always have some excellent
reason for what you do or say. But the Gilchrists
are our best neighbors, and are leading people in
the church. It would be unwise to offend them.
Do you object to telling me why you would not
see Mr. March Gilchrist?”</p>

<p>Hetty shifted the pattern to a corner of the
stuff, turned it upside down and regarded it solemnly,
her head on one side. Then she pinned
it fast and fell again to cutting.</p>

<p>“I do object—decidedly!” she said composedly.
“But it is perhaps best that you should know the
truth. It may prevent unpleasant complications.
Mr. Gilchrist did me the honor last evening to
offer to marry me, and I refused him.”</p>

<p>“Hetty Alling!”</p>

<p>“That is likely to remain my name. I supposed
that you would be surprised. <i>I</i> was!” as coolly
as before. “I trust to your honor to keep Mr.
Gilchrist’s secret, even from Mr. Wayt. It is not
a matter that concerns anybody but ourselves.
And we will not allude to it again.”</p>

<p>Struck by something unnatural in the girl’s
perfect composure, the tender-hearted matron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
leaned forward to stroke the head bowed over
the work.</p>

<p>“There is something behind all this, Hetty,
dear. I am sure of it. It would make me very
happy to see you married to such a man as March
Gilchrist. What objection can you have to him
as a suitor?”</p>

<p>“The very question which he asked and I
answered. Excuse me for reminding you that
nobody else has the right to press it.”</p>

<p>The rebuff did not end the discussion. The
matter was, in Mrs. Wayt’s mind, too grave to be
lightly dismissed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry with me!” staying the progress
of the clicking shears, that her sister might
be compelled to hear what she said, “I love you
too dearly to let you make a blunder you may
regret for a lifetime. March is a noble young
fellow, of unexceptionable family and character.
His disposition is excellent; his manners are
charming; he has talent, energy——”</p>

<p>“Spare me the rest of the catalogue, please!”
retorted Hetty curtly. “It is not like you,
Francis, to force a disagreeable subject upon me.
And this is one of the least agreeable you could
select. Discussion of it is indelicate and a breach
of confidence on my part—and altogether useless
on yours.”</p>

<p>Yet she was especially gentle and affectionate
with her sister for the rest of the day. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
bidding her “good-night” she embraced her
fervently.</p>

<p>“I love you dearly; better this minute than
ever before, if I was so savage this morning,” she
said, with shining eyes, to March’s champion.</p>

<p>Upstairs she read “Locksley Hall” through to
Hester, who was sleepless, until twelve o’clock.
Not until the clock had struck the half-hour after
midnight was Hetty free to take from her pocket
and look at a letter the afternoon mail had
brought. The superscription was in a hand she
had seen in notes to Hester and upon the fly-leaves
of books, and it was still sealed. She sat
looking at it, as it lay within the open palm of a
lax hand for a good (or bad) quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Hester’s regurgitate breathing—worse to-night
than usual—was the only sound in the chamber.
Now and then she raised her hands strugglingly,
as if dreaming, but she slept on.</p>

<p>To open that letter and take the contents into
her empty heart would be to the lonely orphan
Heaven on earth. It was long, for the envelope
held several sheets. It was eloquent, for she had
heard him talk upon the theme set forth in every
line. She had will-force sufficient to conceal from
the sister, whose heart would be broken by the
truth, her reasons for refusing to link hers with
the unsmirched name of the man she loved. She
was not strong enough to put her finger under
the flap of that envelope and read a single line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and then persist in doing right. Perhaps, in spite
of the repulse of the morning, he had again
called her “darling!”</p>

<p>She durst not risk the seeing; she had strength
given her to keep the resolution, but she did no
more that night. The answer must wait until
morning. The letter was hidden under the pillow,
and her hand touched it while she slept and
while she lay awake. In the still, purple dawn,
she arose quietly, not to disturb Hester, dressed
herself and knelt for a brief prayer, such as the
busiest member of the household had time to
offer. While she prayed she held the unopened
letter to her heart. Arising, she kissed it lingeringly.</p>

<p>“God bless my love!” she whispered.</p>

<p>With steady fingers she wrote upon the reverse
of the envelope: “<i>I cannot read this. Do not
write again</i>,” slipped it into a larger cover, addressed
it, and, before the family was astir, sent
Homer with it to the nearest letter box.</p>

<p>She had acted bravely, and, she believed, decisively,
but she had blundered withal. An
unopened letter, unaccompanied by a word of
extenuation of the flagrant discourtesy, might
damp the ardor of the most adoring lover. Yet
March’s eyes were lit by a ray of affectionate
amusement in receiving back this, the first love
letter he had ever penned. He kissed the one-line
sentence before putting the envelope away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps she is afraid of herself!” May had
suggested sagely, <i>à propos</i> of Hetty’s avoidance of
his visits.</p>

<p>The bright-natured suitor’s conclusion, after
reading what was meant as a quietus to his addresses,
was not dissimilar. If the case were
hopeless she would have written nothing. Nevertheless,
he bowed to the laconic: “Do not write
again.” He did more than she had commanded.
Without attempting to see Hetty again, he escorted
his sister in the second week of July to
Long Branch, and stayed there a fortnight, then
went with her to Mt. Desert for ten days more.</p>

<p>The malign influence of a dog-day drought was
upon Fairhill when the pair returned. The
streets were deep in dust, the sun, a red and
rayless ball, had rolled from east to west, and
taken his own time in doing it, and was staining
to a dingy crimson horizon-vapors that looked
as dry as the dust, as brother and sister paused
upon the piazza for a look over the familiar landscape.</p>

<p>“It is stifling after the seashore!” breathed
May. “But it is home! I am <i>glad</i> to be back!”</p>

<p>“And I—always!”</p>

<p>March said it, in stooping, hat in hand, to kiss
his mother. There was the ring of sincerity in
his voice; his eyes were placid. He had come
home to her cured of an ill-starred fancy for an
ineligible girl. There was no sign of anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
more than neighborly interest in his face when
May asked at dinner-time how the Wayts were.</p>

<p>“Well, I believe,” replied Mrs. Gilchrist. “I
have seen comparatively little of them while you
were away, except at church. It has been too
hot for visiting. Yesterday I took Hester out to
drive. She misses you sadly, May. She is
thinner and has less color than when you went
away.”</p>

<p>“Dear little Queen Mab!” said Hester’s friend.
“I must have her over to-morrow to spend the
day. I have some books and sketches for her.
And Hetty?”</p>

<p>“Is as busy as usual, Hester tells me. She
goes out very little, I believe. The young
people hereabouts call her a recluse.”</p>

<p>The unconscious judge came to the relief of
all parties.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wayt’s congregation continues large,” he
remarked. “He preached a truly remarkable
sermon last Sunday. At this rate we will have
to pull down our church and build a larger by
next year.”</p>

<p>The wife looked gratified. It was much to
have her husband speak of “our church.”</p>

<p>May was content to wait for the morrow’s meeting
with her pet. Hester was wild with impatience
to be again with her worshiped friend.
Hetty might remonstrate, and her mother entreat
her not to intrude upon the family on the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the travelers’ arrival. The spoiled child was
unmanageable. She could not sleep a wink, she
protested, until she had kissed Miss May, and exchanged
reports of the weeks separating them
from the dear everyday intercourse. She would
take with her the portfolio she had almost worked
herself ill to fill with what May must think showed
diligent endeavor to improve.</p>

<p>“Then, there is the great news to tell!”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be well to wait a while before
speaking of that?” dissuaded the mother.</p>

<p>“It is a week old, already!” Hester pouted,
“and I said never a word to Mrs. Gilchrist yesterday.
‘The Seasons’”—the <i>mot de famille</i> at the
Gilchrists’ for brother and sister—“are our only
<i>own</i> friends, mamma. You can trust them to hold
their tongues!”</p>

<p>“What seems a great event to us will be small
to them,” cautioned Mrs. Wayt—then gave Hester
her way.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock saw her in Homer’s charge on the
orchard road, the shortest, as it was the most
secluded, to the Gilchrist place.</p>

<p>“Where <i>are</i> you taking me, Tony?” she aroused
from a happy, expectant reverie to ask, midway.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the June mowing was tall by
now, and the chair was almost hidden in it.</p>

<p>“Now—I don’ keer fur to take ye near that big
tree. ’Taint wholesome nor proper!” grunted
the charioteer. He was slightly afraid of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
testy little damsel, and took on doughty airs at
times to disprove the fact. “We’ll soon git inter
the path agi’n.”</p>

<p>“But I won’t stand this!” cried Hester, irate.
“Go back to the path! Not wholesome! not
proper! What do you mean!”</p>

<p>“Now—I seen the light there oftener’n anywheres
else”—Homer was beginning, when they
were hailed by a well-known voice.</p>

<p>“What are you doing over there?” called
March.</p>

<p>“Swimming for our lives,” returned Hester.
“Won’t you dive, and drag me out by the hair of
my head?”</p>

<p>Her tone was tremulous with delight. As he
took her hand, it quivered like a poplar leaf in his
large, cordial grasp. He was fond of Hester on
her own account, fonder of her because he linked
her with Hetty. He had strolled down the street
with his cigar after giving his mother a detailed
account of the pleasure making of the last three
weeks. He felt the heat inland to be oppressive
after the surf breeze. His mother was glad that
his saunter was not in the direction of the parsonage.
She knew nothing of the short cut from the
back street, or with what ease an athlete of six-and-twenty
could vault a five-barred fence. Besides,
was not her boy a cured and discharged
patient!</p>

<p>The meeting with Hester, if not the best thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
he had hoped for, was so much better than a solitary
ramble in dream-haunted grounds that he
greeted her joyously. It was not the first time
the idea had come to him of making a confidante
of the keen-witted, deep-hearted child, but it suddenly
took the shape of determination.</p>

<p>“Going to see May!” He echoed her reply to
his next question. “She is tired out, and has gone
to her room by this. She means to claim you for
the whole of to-morrow. Give me a little chat in
our arbor instead, and I will take you home. I
have not seen you for an age, and I have something
very interesting to me and important to
you, to say to you.”</p>

<p>She laughed up in his face in sheer pleasure.</p>

<p>“And I have something particularly interesting
to me, and not important to you, to tell in return.
We have an event in our family—an agreeable
happening as to results, although it comes by a
dark and crooked road—or so mamma persists in
saying.”</p>

<p>March had propelled her into the open track
and stopped as she said this to lean forward and
peer into the saucy face. A disagreeable—an
absurd—thrill passed over him. Had he lost
Hetty?</p>

<p>“An event! Accomplished or prospective?”</p>

<p>“Both!” chuckled Hester.</p>

<p>“Is it an engagement?” bringing out the word
courageously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The question was never answered. A vigorous
onward push had brought them into the moonlit
area surrounding the king apple tree. Thor
rushed forward, bellowing ferociously at a long
black body that lay half under, half beyond the
dipping outward branches, now weighted almost
to the ground with growing fruit.</p>

<p>“Homer!” shouted March to the figure retreating
toward the garden. “Come back! hurry!”
And, hastily, to Hester: “I will send you home
with him and go for the police. Don’t be
frightened. It is only a drunken tramp, or may
be a sleeper. In either case he cannot stay here.
These are my father’s grounds.”</p>

<p>Hester had not uttered a sound, but the slight
figure, bent toward the recumbent man, had a
strained intensity of expression words could not
have conveyed. Her eyes were fixed, as by the
fascination of horrified dread—one small hand
plucked oddly at her throat.</p>

<p>“Take her home, Homer!” March ordered,
“and say nothing to alarm the ladies. I’ll attend
to <i>him!</i>”</p>

<p>“No! <i>no!</i> <span class="smcap">NO!</span>” shrilled Hester in an unearthly
tone that made him start. “You must go home!
you! <i>you!</i> and say nothing! tell nobody! O God
of mercy, it has come at last! Don’t touch him!”
her voice rising into a husky shriek. For, parting
the boughs, March passed to the head of the
prostrate man, and stooped to raise him. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
quick eye had perceived that he was well dressed
and no common tramp in figure, also that he had
lain, not fallen, where he was found. In bending
to take hold of him, he detected, even in the
intensity of his excitement, the peculiar, heavy,
close odor of drugs that had hung in the air on
the Fourth of July night. In company with a
policeman, our young artist had once visited
a Chinese “opium dive” in New York, and he
recognized the smell now.</p>

<p>Homer was beside him, and lent intelligent aid.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>,” he drawled, without the slightest evidence
of alarm, “<i>I</i> mos’ly lif’s him up <i>so</i>-fashion!”</p>

<p>The action brought the features into a rift of
moonlight.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens!” broke from March in a
low tone of horror and dismay. “It is Mr.
Wayt!”</p>

<p>Laying him on the turf he went back to Hester
and seized the bar of her chair.</p>

<p>“You must go home! You must not see him,
my poor child! It is your father, and he is very
ill—unconscious. Not a moment is to be lost. I
must go for a doctor immediately!”</p>

<p>“<i>Let go!</i>”</p>

<p>Beside herself with fury, she actually struck at
the hand grasping the propeller; her eyes flashed
fire; her accents, hardly louder than a wheezing
whisper, were jerky gasps, painful to hear.</p>

<p>“Let go, I say! and do you go to your safe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
decent home, as I told you! Tony and I are
used to this sort of thing!”</p>

<p>“Hester! you do not know what you are
saying!” March came around and faced her,
trying to quiet her by cold, stern authority.</p>

<p>It was thrown away. She raved on—still tearing
away with her tiny fierce hands at her
heaving throat as if to give speech freer vent.</p>

<p>“I do know—oh, we are graduates in these frolicsome
escapades! It is inconsiderate in him—”
with a horrid laugh—“to give his wife, his
wife’s sister, and the family factotum such a job
as carrying him all this way. To do him justice,
he seldom forgets the decencies so entirely. If I
had my way, he should lie here all night. Only
his wife would come out and stay with him.
What are you staring at me for, Mr. Gilchrist?
Here is our family skeleton! Does it frighten
you out of your wits?”</p>

<p>Her croaks of laughter threatened dissolution to
the fragile frame. It was an awful, a repulsive
exhibition.</p>

<p>“It is you who have lost yours!” rejoined
March gravely. “Your father may be dying, for
aught you know. A hundred men fell in the
streets of New York to-day, overcome by the heat—and
we are wasting precious minutes in wild,
nonsensical talk. If you will let Homer take you
to the house, and compose yourself sufficiently to
prepare your mother for the shock of seeing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
husband brought in insensible, we may save him
yet. Go! and send Homer back at once.”</p>

<p>The wild eyes surveyed him piercingly; with a
low, meaning laugh, she sank back among her
cushions.</p>

<p>“I think”—she said distinctly and deliberately—“that
you are the best man God ever made!
Go on, Tony!”</p>

<p>Left alone with the unconscious man, March
stooped and rolled him entirely over. He had
been lying, face downward, his cheek to the
sward; one arm was by his side, the other was
thrown in a natural position above his head.
His pulse was almost normal, although somewhat
sluggish; his respiration heavy, but not stertorous:
his complexion was not sanguine. His
breath and, March fancied, his whole body reeked
of opium. March shook him gently. He slept
on. With a disgustful shiver, he forced himself
to pass an arm under his head and lift it to his
knee. There was no change in the limp lethargy.
The young man laid him down, and, rising, stood
off and looked at the pitiable wreck. Hester’s
frenzied tirade had disabused the listener’s mind
of the suspicion of suicide. He could no longer
doubt that here was the unraveling of the complex
design that had vexed his heart and head.
The popular preacher was not the first of brilliant
parts and high position who had fallen a victim to
a debasing and insidious habit, but his skill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
effrontery in concealing the truth were remarkable.
Yet—might not March have divined the nature of
the mystery before this revelation? The peculiar
brilliancy of the deep-set eyes; his variable spirits;
his fluent and, at times, erratic speech; the very
character of his pulpit eloquence—might have
betrayed him to an expert. His wife’s nervous
vigilance and eager assiduity of devotion—above
all, the episode of the midnight toilers, and the
conflicting stories of the need of that toil—finally—and
he recalled it with a bursting heart—Hetty’s
declaration to her lover that there were insurmountable
obstacles to their union—were as clear
as daylight now. The sudden illness of that
memorable Saturday night was stupor like that
which now chained the slave of appetite to the
earth.</p>

<p>How often and with what excess of anguish the
revolting scene had been enacted only the two
unhappy sisters knew, unless the still more hapless
daughter were in the secret. Her wail, “Oh,
God of mercy! it has come at last!” was a key
to depths of suspenseful endurance and labyrinths
of unavailing deception.</p>

<p>Unavailing, for the instant of detection was
the beginning of the end. The man was ruined
beyond redemption. A whisper of his infirmity
would be the loss of place, reputation, and livelihood,
and his innocent family would go down
quick into the pit with him. This was the vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of impending gloom that had disturbed what
should be sunny deeps in the sweetest eyes in the
world to him. This was the almost certain prospect
that made her write, “I can never be more
than your friend!”</p>

<p>The Gilchrist was clean, honest blood. Hetty
testified her appreciation of this truth by refusing
to marry him. He could think how his mother
would look when she had heard the story and
how Fairhill gossip would gloat over the “newest
thing in clerical scandals!”</p>

<p>Why should it be made public? Why should
he not help to keep it quiet instead of pulling
down ruin upon the helpless and unoffending?
Hetty had written, “In mercy to the innocent.”
He seemed to hear her say it now, in
his ear.</p>

<p>A faint melodious chime just vibrated through
the sultry air. The fine bell of the “Old First”
had struck the half hour. The church in which
he was baptized; the church of his mother’s love
and prayers! At thought of the pulpit desecrated
by this fellow’s feet, a rush of indignant contempt
surged up to his lips.</p>

<p>“Sacrilegious dog!” he muttered, touching
the motionless heap with his foot.</p>

<p>Homer shambled back out of breath. He had
brought a lantern.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>—it’s powerful shady under the trees!”
he replied to March’s remark that the moon gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
all the light they required. “An’ ther’s somethin’
come ter me, as I want ter see!”</p>

<p>He set down the lantern, hugged the tree bole,
and went up a foot or two. Then were heard a
scratching and a rattling overhead.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>—would ye a mind holdin’ this ’tell I git
’em all?”</p>

<p>The “all” were four bottles and a tin box.
Two phials were long and empty. A name was
blown in the glass. March held one down to the
light.</p>

<p>“<i>Elixir of Opium!</i>”</p>

<p>The others were larger and of stout blue glass.
A printed label said “<i>Phosphate</i>.” March pulled
out a cork and smelled the contents. Opium
again!</p>

<p>The box held the same drug as a dark paste.</p>

<p>“I mistrusted them horsephates a coople o’
times!” said Homer, imperturbably sagacious.
“He wor too everlastin’ fond of ’em. He skeered
me with the devil inter goin’ ter the drug store
with a paper ter tell ’em for ter give me that ar’
one,” designating an empty phial. “Leastways,
one like it. An’ Miss Hetty, she foun’ it in the
garding, where I drapped it. Then, ’twas she tole
me nivver to go nowhar ’thout ’twas she sent me.
An’ I aint sence! An’ he’s t’reatened me orful
a many a time ’cause what she said to me that
time. I guess he bought ’em in New York, mos’
likely. He’s a sharp un—Mr. Wayt is!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>March eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“How did you know where these things were,
if you had nothing to do with hiding them!”</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i>”—stolid under the implied doubt, or not
noticing it—“you reklec’ the Sunday night me ’n
you was talkin’ here, ’n’ <i>he</i> come along, an’ I
shinned up the tree? I bet”—with more animation
than March had ever seen him display
before—“he was a-comin’ for a drink then!
’Twas the very night before, when Miss Hetty,
she come all the way up to my room, an’ sez she,
‘Homer,’ sez she, ‘Mr. Wayt has done it agin,’
she say. An’ so he had, an’ him a lyin’ on the
study floor jes’ as you see him now—an’ Mrs.
Wayt a-cryin’ over him. You see she’d b’lieved,
sure an’ certain, he’d nuvver do so no more. But
<i>I</i> mistrusted them horsephates. <i>Now</i>, that very
night—Sunday night ’twas, ’n’ me an’ you was a-talkin’
here—as I was a-slidin’ down the tree I
kotched inter a hole, an’ somethin’ sort o’ jingled,
like glass. I nuvver t’ought no more ’bout it tell
jes’ ez I come up to-night an’ see him a-sprawlin’
thar, an’ I smelled the stuff. I’ll jes’ hide ’em in
the grass, an’ to-morrow early I’ll bury ’em in the
garding. But it’s a quare cupboard, that is.”</p>

<p>While talking, he was busy spreading upon the
turf a heavy shawl, such as were worn by men,
forty years ago. “<i>Now</i>—ef you’ll lend a lift to
him!” to the wondering observer.</p>

<p>The plan was ingenious, but Homer’s dexterity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in carrying it out, and the <i>sangfroid</i> he maintained
throughout, betokened an amount of practice
at which March’s soul recoiled. It was
frightfully realistic. Mr. Wayt was laid in the
middle of the big plaid; the two ends were
knotted tightly upon his chest, inclosing his
arms, the other two about his ankles.</p>

<p>“I’ll hitch on to the heavy eend,” quoth the
bunch of muscle and bone March had begun to
admire. “Me bein’ useter to it nor what you be.
You take holt on his feet.”</p>

<p>In such style the stately saint was borne up the
back steps and laid upon the settee in the parsonage
hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt was upon the porch. Her first
words gave one of the bearers his cue.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Gilchrist! This is dreadful! And he
seemed so well at dinner time! The heat often
affects him seriously. He had a sunstroke some
years ago, and every summer he feels the effects
of it. Lay him down here and rest before taking
him upstairs. There. Thank you.”</p>

<p>While she undid and removed the clerical
cravat and collar from his throat, March straightened
his spine and looked around for Hetty.
The house was as still as a grave. The front door
was closed; the rooms on both sides of the hall
were dark and silent. It was Thursday night,
the universal “evening out” for Fairhill servants.
March recollected it in the mechanical way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
one thinks of trifles at important junctures. He
was glad—mechanically—that Mary Ann was not
there to carry the tale of Mr. Wayt’s fainting fit,
or semi-sunstroke, or whatever name his wife
chose to put to it, to Mrs. Gilchrist. He was
beginning to ask himself what he should say at
home of what he had done with himself between
nine and ten o’clock that evening.</p>

<p>The transportation up to the second story was
slow and difficult. Mrs. Wayt supported her husband’s
head, and, like a flash, recurred to March
Hester’s sneer of the task laid upon “his wife,
his wife’s sister, and the family factotum.” It
must have been barely accomplished on the July
night when he and May brought Hester home,
and Hetty ran down out of breath, her hair
disheveled and eyes scared! That <i>her</i> hands
should be fouled by such a burden!</p>

<p>His face was set whitely, as, having deposited
the load upon the bed, he accosted the wife:</p>

<p>“Would you like to have a physician?”</p>

<p>His tone was hard and constrained. She did
not look up.</p>

<p>“You are very good but it is not necessary—thank
you! I have seen him as ill before from
the same cause and know what to do for him.
And he is morbidly sensitive with regard to these
attacks. He thinks it would injure him in his
profession if the impression were to get abroad
that his health is unsound or his constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
breaking up. I shall not even dare tell him that
you have seen him to-night.”</p>

<p>She was putting extraordinary force upon herself,
but she could not meet his eye.</p>

<p>“I cannot thank you just now as I would, Mr.
Gilchrist. I am all unnerved, and although I
know this seizure is not dangerous, it is a terrible
ordeal to me to witness it. May I ask that you
will not mention it, even to Judge and Mrs. Gilchrist?
My husband would be mortified and distressed
beyond measure were his illness the subject
of even friendly remark.”</p>

<p>March hesitated, and she turned upon him
quickly. Her face was that of an old woman—gray,
withered, and scored with lines, each one of
which meant an agony.</p>

<p>His resolution dissolved like the frost before
fire.</p>

<p>“You may depend upon my discretion and
friendship,” he said impulsively.</p>

<p>She burst into tears, the low, convulsive sobbing
he had heard above stairs on that other
night.</p>

<p>Unable to bear more he ran down the staircase,
and recognized before he reached the foot
that he had committed himself to a lie.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gilchrist!”</p>

<p>His hand was upon the lock of the front door
when he caught the low call.</p>

<p>Hetty stood upon the threshold of the library,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a shadowy figure in white that seemed to waver
in the uncertain light.</p>

<p>“I should like to speak to you, if you can spare
a few minutes,” she pursued, leading the way into
the room.</p>

<p>With a bow of acquiescence he sat down and
waited for her to begin. His mind was in a
tumult; dumb pain devoured him. He felt as
any honorable man might feel who condones a
felony.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">My</span> sister has begged you to keep secret what
you have seen to-night—has she not?” was
Hetty’s first inquiry, spoken without haste and
without excitement.</p>

<p>A mute bow replied.</p>

<p>“And you have promised to do it?”</p>

<p>“I told Mrs. Wayt that she might depend upon
my discretion.”</p>

<p>“Which she construes into a pledge to connive
at a wrong done to a church and a community,”
in precisely the same tone and manner as before.</p>

<p>March stared at her perplexedly. What did
the girl mean? And was this resolute, impassive
woman of business the blushing trembler who,
a month ago, could not deny her love for him?
She was very serious now, but apparently very
tranquil.</p>

<p>“You would say, if you were not too kind-hearted,
that this is what I am doing—what I
have been doing for nearly ten years—and you
would be right. It would not exculpate me in
your opinion if I were to represent that Mr.
Wayt’s profession is all that stands between his
family and the poorhouse; that I do not habitually
attend the church in which he officiates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that my name has never appeared upon the
record of any one of the parishes of which he has
had charge since I became a member of his family.
Mr. Wayt and I have not exchanged a syllable
directly for over five years. I neither respect nor
like him. He can never forgive my knowledge of
his character, and my interference with his habits.
These were confirmed before I came to my
sister.”</p>

<p>“Let me beg,” interposed March, “that you
will not go on with what cannot but be distressing
to you. You need no justification in my sight.
If you will permit me to call to-morrow morning
we can talk matters over calmly and at leisure.
It is late, and you have had a severe nervous
strain.”</p>

<p>“Unless you insist upon the postponement I
would rather speak now, while my mind is steady
in the purpose to make an end of subterfuge and
concealment. I <i>am</i> weary, but it is of falsehoods,
acted and spoken. Hester has told me of your
generous pretense of misunderstanding the nature
of Mr. Wayt’s attack. There it is again!”—relapsing
into her usual tone, and with whimsical vexation
that made March smile. “I am afraid I
have forgotten how to be frank! My poor sister’s
eager talk of ‘attacks’ and ‘seizures’ and ‘turns’
and ‘sunstroke’ and ‘constitutional headaches’
has unbalanced my perceptions of right and
wrong.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“You cannot expect me to agree with you
there?” the suppressed smile becoming visible.</p>

<p>She was not to be turned aside from the straight
track.</p>

<p>“Nothing so perverts conscience as a systematic
course of concealment, even when it is practiced
for what seem to be noble ends. I have
felt this for a long time. Lately the sense of guilt
has been insupportable. It may be relief—if not
expiation—to tell the truth in the plainest terms
I can use. It may leave me more wretched than
I am now. But right is right.”</p>

<p>Her chin trembled and she raised her hand to
cover it. Her admirable composure was smoldering
excitement, kept under by will and the conscience
whose rectitude she undervalued. With
a sub-pang, March perceived that this disclosure
was not a confidence, but a duty.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wayt was a confirmed opium eater and
drinker, twelve years ago,” she resumed in a cold
monotone. “He would drink intoxicating liquors,
too, when narcotics were not to be had. I believe
the appetite for the two is a common symptom of
the habit. His wife shielded him, then, as she
does now, and so successfully that he kept a
church in Cincinnati for four years. Hester was
a beautiful, active child, eight years old, and a
great pet with her father. He does not care for
children, as a rule, but she was pretty and clever
and amused him. One day she begged her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
mother to let her take ‘dear papa’s’ lunch up to
him. It was always ‘dear papa’ with her. He
had a way of locking himself in his study from
morning until night Saturday. Even his wife did
not suspect that he wrote his Sunday sermon
with a glass of laudanum and brandy at his side.
He was busy upon a set of popular discourses on
‘Crying Sins of the Day.’ They drew immense
crowds.”</p>

<p>A sarcastic gleam passed over her face, and for
the first time the listener saw a likeness to the
witty and wise cripple.</p>

<p>“Hester knocked again and again without getting
answered. Then her father called out that he
was busy and did not want any lunch. She was
always willful, and he had indulged her unreasonably.
So she declared that she would not go away
until he opened the door and took the tray—not if
she had to stand there and knock all day. He
tore open the door in a fury, threw the tray and
the lunch downstairs, and flung the child after it.
The drugged drink had made him crazy.”</p>

<p>March shuddered.</p>

<p>“And that was the cause——”</p>

<p>“It left her what you see, now. The effect
upon her character and feelings was, if possible,
more deplorable. From that hour she has never
spoken to her father at all, or of him as ‘papa.’
It is always ‘he’ and ‘him’ to the family,
‘Mr. Wayt’ to strangers. It seems horribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
unnatural, but she loathes and despises him.
While she lay crushed and suffering for the
months that passed before she left her bed, she
would go into convulsions at sight of him. Her
mother begged her, on her knees, to ‘forgive
poor papa, who had a delirious headache when
he pushed her away from the door.’ Hester
refused passionately. She is no more forgiving
now. Yet she was so proud and shrewd, even
then, that she never betrayed to the doctors how
she was hurt. She let everybody believe that it
was an accident. I had been her nurse for six
months before she told me the fearful story.</p>

<p>“The truth never got abroad in Cincinnati, but
flying rumors of Mr. Wayt’s growing eccentricities
and the possible cause gathered an opposition
party in the church. It was headed by a
prominent druggist, who had talked with others
in the trade from whom Mr. Wayt had bought
opium, laudanum, and brandy. He has been
more cunning in his purchases since then. He
was obliged to resign his charge, and became
what poor Hester calls ‘an ecclesiastical tramp.’
He controls his appetite within tolerably safe
bounds for a while, sometimes for months, then
gives way, and we live on the verge of discovery
and disgrace until the crisis comes. The end is
always the same. We break camp and ‘move on.’”</p>

<p>“Yet he brought clean papers to the Fairhill
church.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>A dreary smile went with the answer.</p>

<p>“Clerical charity suffereth long and is kind!
Out of curiosity I attended once a meeting of
a presbytery that dismissed him from his church
and commended him to another presbytery. We
had narrowly escaped public exposure at that
time. The sexton found Mr. Wayt in the condition
you have seen this evening upon the floor
of the lecture room and called in a physician, who
boldly proclaimed that the man was ‘dead drunk.’
The accused put in a plea of indisposition and
an overdose of brandy, inadvertently swallowed.
His brethren, assembled in solemn session, spoke
of his faithful work in the vineyard and the leadings
of Divine Providence, and said that their
prayers went with him to his new field of labor.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be unjust or cynical, Mr. Gilchrist,
and I can see that there is a pleasanter
side to the case. There <i>is</i> such a thing as Christian
charity, and more of it in the world than we
are willing to admit. However church people
may gossip about an unpopular pastor, and
maneuver to get rid of him, when the parting
comes they will not brand him in the eyes of
others. And clergymen are very faithful to one
another. It is really beautiful to see how they
try to hide faults and foibles. It is a literal
fulfillment of the command, ‘Bear ye one another’s
burdens.’ In some—in most of Mr.
Wayt’s charges—the secret of his frequent change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of pastorate was not told. He was ‘odd,’ and
‘had nomadic tastes.’ Sometimes the climate
did not agree with his health. The air was too
strong or too weak. Twice poor Hester’s condition
demanded an immediate change. We went
to Chicago to be near an eminent surgeon, who,
after all, never saw her.</p>

<p>“I will not weary you with the details of a life
such as I pray God few families know. After
a few years Hester and I became hopeless of
anything better. Wherever we might go, change,
and the probability of disgrace, were a mere question
of time. My sister never loses faith in her
husband and in an overruling Power that will
not forsake the righteous. For, strange as it
may seem, she believes in the piety of a man
whose sacred profession is a continual lie.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Gilchrist!” the enforced monotony of
her tone wavering into a cry of pain—“I think
<i>that</i> is the worst of all! When I recollect my
mother’s pure religion—when I see your mother’s
beneficent life and firm faith in goodness and in
God—when I know that, in spite of the seeming
untruthfulness which is, she thinks, necessary to
protect her husband—my sister holds fast to her
love and trust in an Almighty Friend, and walks
humbly with her God, I feel such indignation
against a man who is the slave of passion, selfish,
vain, and conscienceless, and yet assumes to show
such souls the way to heaven, that I dare not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
enter the church where he is allowed to preach,
lest I should cry out in the face of his hearers
against the monstrous cheat!”</p>

<p>Her eyes flamed clear; the torrent of feeling
swept away reserve and coldness.</p>

<p>“I understand!” March said, with sympathetic
warmth. “You never disappoint me. Tell me
what I can do to help you. I cannot let you
endure all this alone any longer.”</p>

<p>“Nobody can take my share of the burden. I
would hardly know myself without it. It will be
the heavier for my sister’s distress and Hester’s
anger when they hear what I have decided to do.
Hester was on her way over to your house when
you met her, full of news she could not wait until
to-morrow to tell. My mother’s only brother
went to Japan thirty years ago and became rich.
He died last March, leaving most of his fortune
to benevolent institutions in America. To each
of us, his sister’s children, he bequeathed ten
thousand dollars. It is not a fortune, but with
our modest tastes, and when joined to the little
I already have, it will support us decently. My
first thought, when the news reached us, a week
ago, was ‘Now, Mr. Wayt need never take another
charge! We need not live upon tainted
food!’”</p>

<p>“You are a noble woman, Hetty——”</p>

<p>She interrupted him.</p>

<p>“I am not! This is not self-sacrifice, but self-preservation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
If the money had not been given
to us, I must have found some way out of a false
position. I want you to tell your father all you
know. Keep back nothing I have told you. He
is a good and a merciful man. Let him speak
openly to Mr. Wayt and forbid him ever to enter
the pulpit again upon penalty of public exposure
and suspension from the ministry. What Judge
Gilchrist says will have weight. With all his high
looks and sounding talk, Mr. Wayt is a coward.
He would not venture to resist the decision.
Then we will go away quietly. I have thought
of the little town in which my sister and I were
born. Living is cheap there and there are excellent
schools for the children. Twenty-five thousand
dollars will go very far in that region, and
we can be honest people once more.”</p>

<p>“You have arranged it all, have you?” said
March, not at all in the tone she had expected to
hear. “Give them the cheap town, and the good
schools, and the twenty-five thousand dollars by
all means. They can have everything but <i>you!</i>”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> long storm in August set in next day. A
fine, close drizzle veiled the world by 7 o’clock.
At 8.30, the twins and Fanny needed their waterproof
cloaks for the walk to school. By noon the
patter on the piazza roof and falling floods upon
lawn and garden and streets were slow, but abundant.
It was scrubbing day and closet day, and,
as Hester fretted sometimes to methodical Mary
Ann on Friday, “all the rest of the week,” below
stairs. Hetty had to prepare a dessert and to set
the lunch table. Before going down she made
up a little fire in the sewing room, and put out
Hester’s color-box, glass of water, stretching
board, paper, and easel within easy reach, should
she decide to use them. Silently, and not too
suggestively, she set upon the table near by a
vase containing some fine specimens of the moccasin
flower sent in by May Gilchrist, with a note
addressed to “Queen Mab.” Hester hated hints,
but if she lacked a study she would not have to
look far for it.</p>

<p>It was “a bad day” with her. Her mother attributed
it partly to her disappointment at not
seeing her crony teacher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Hetty, who had put the excited child to bed as
soon as she got into the house the night before, held
her peace. Mrs. Wayt, hovering from the nursery
and her husband’s chamber to the sewing room,
saw that in her taciturn daughter’s countenance
that warned and kept her aloof. Another of
Hester’s biting sayings was that her mother, on the
day succeeding one of her spouse’s “seizures” was
“betwixt the devil and the deep sea.” She never
admitted, even to her sister, that “dear Percy”
was more than “unfortunate,” yet read Hetty’s
disapprobation in averted looks and studiously
commonplace talk.</p>

<p>Wan and limp the cripple reclined among the
cushions Hetty packed about her in her wheeled
chair. Blue shadows ringed mouth and eyes, and
stretched themselves in the hollowed temples;
the deft fingers were nerveless. Most of the time
she seemed to watch the rain under drooping eyelids,
so transparent as to show the dark irides
beneath.</p>

<p>At half past eleven her mother stole in like a
bit of drifted down.</p>

<p>“Dear, I have promised papa to go up to your
room and lie down for half an hour. Annie is
with him. She amuses him, and will be very
good, she says. I told her to let you know if she
wanted anything. May I leave the door open?
She cannot turn this stiff bolt.”</p>

<p>Annie was one of Hester’s weak points.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
“Baby” never made her nervous or impatient,
and much of the little one’s precocity was due to
intimate companionship with the disabled sister,
whose plaything she was.</p>

<p>“Yes. All right!” murmured Hester, closing
her eyes entirely.</p>

<p>She was deathly pallid in the uncolored gloom
of a rainy noon.</p>

<p>“Or—if you feel like taking a nap, yourself?”
hesitated Mrs. Wayt.</p>

<p>Tactful with her husband, and tender with all
her household, she yet had the misfortune often
to rub Hester’s fur the wrong way. The delicately
pencilled brows met over frowning eyes.</p>

<p>“No! no! you know I never sleep in the day!
If you would never bother yourself with my peace
and comfort, mamma, we should be on better
terms. I am not a baby, or a—husband!”</p>

<p>She was not sorry for her ill humor or for the
long gap between the last article and noun, when
left to herself.</p>

<p>She lay upon a bed of thorns, each of which
was endued with intelligent vitality. Earth was a
waste. Heaven had never been. Hate herself
for it as she might she had never, in all her rueful
existence, known suffering comparable to that
condensed into the three little minutes she had
lived twelve hours ago.</p>

<p>When Hetty had come up to bed her face was
beautiful with a strange white peace, at sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
which Hester held her breath. Coming swiftly,
but without bustle, across the room, she kneeled
by the bed and gathered the frail form in the
dear, strong arms that had cradled it a thousand
times. Her eyes sparkled, her lips were parted
by quick breaths, but she tried to speak quietly.</p>

<p>“Precious child! you should be asleep. But I
am glad you are not, for I have a message for
you. We—you and I—are to take no anxious
thought for to-morrow, or for any more of the
to-morrows we are to spend together. March
told me to say that and to give you this!” laying
a kiss upon her lips. “For he loves me, Hester,
darling, and you are to live with us! Just as we
planned, ever and ever so long ago! But what
day dream was ever so beautiful as this?”</p>

<p>For one of the three awful minutes Hester
thought and hoped she was dying. The frightened
blood ebbed back with turbulence that
threw her into a spasm of trembling and weeping.
She recollected pushing Hetty away, then clutching
her frantically to pull her down for a storm of
passionate kisses given between tearless sobs.
Then she gave way to wheezing shrieks of
laughter, which Hetty tried to check. She would
not let her move or speak after that.</p>

<p>“How thoughtless in me not to know that you
were too much unnerved to bear another shock—even
of happiness!” said the loving nurse. “No!
don’t try to offer so much as a word of congratulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
It will keep! All we have to do to-night
is to obey the order of our superior officer, and
not think—only trust!”</p>

<p>In the morning there was no opportunity for
speech-making. A night of suffering had beaten
Hester dumb.</p>

<p>“Nobody could be surprised at that!” cooed
Hetty, as she rubbed and bathed the throbbing
spine. “If I could but pour down this aching
column some of my redundant vitality!”</p>

<p>Hester detested herself in acknowledging the
fervent sincerity of the wish. Hetty would
willingly divide her life with her, as she had
said yesterday that she meant to divide her
fortune.</p>

<p>“Half for you while I live! All for you when
I am gone!”</p>

<p>The sad sweetness of the smile accompanying
the words was as little like the wonderful white
shining of last night as the lot cast for Hetty was
like that of the deformed dwarf whose height of
grotesque folly was attained when she loved—first,
in dreams and in “drifting”—then, all
unconsciously, in actual scenes and waking moments—one
whose whole heart belonged to the
woman who had “made her over,” to whom she
owed life, brain, and soul!</p>

<p>She was to live with them! Hetty must make
her partaker of her every good. By force of long
habit, Hester fell to planning the house the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
would inhabit. She was herself—always helpless,
never less a burden than now—a piece of rubbish
in the pretty rooms, a clog upon domestic
machinery—a barrier to social pleasure—the inadmissible
third in the married <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>She writhed impotently. More useless than a
toy; more troublesome than a baby—uglier than
the meanest insect that crawls—she must yet
submit to the fate that fastened her upon the
young lives of her custodians.</p>

<p>“I doubt if I could even take my own life!” she
meditated darkly. “In my fits of rage and
despair, I used to threaten to roll my chair down
the stairs and break my neck to ‘finish the job.’
I said it once to mamma. I wonder sometimes if
that is the reason Tony puts up gates across the
top of the stairs wherever we go? He says it is
to keep baby Annie from tumbling down. I
haven’t cared to die lately, but to-day I wish my
soul had floated clean out of my body in that five
minute make-believe under the pink tent of the
apple tree, three months ago.</p>

<p>“I suppose he will be coming here constantly,
now. Hetty won’t belong to me anymore. I am
very wicked! I am jealous of her with him, and
of him with her! I am a spiteful, malicious,
broken-backed toad! Oh, how I despise Hester
Wayt! And I owe it all to <i>him!</i>”</p>

<p>She glowered revengefully at the door her
mother had left unclosed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Baby Annie was having a lovely hour with “dee
papa.” He had not left his bed, but the nausea
and sense of goneness with which he had
awakened, were yielding to the administration of
minute potions of opium by his wife, at stated
intervals. A fit of delirium tremens, induced by
the failure to “cool him off” <i>secundum artem</i>,
had brought about Homer’s introduction to his
nominal employer. Routed from his secret lodgings
under the roof-tree at one o’clock of a winter
morning, Hetty’s waif had first run for a doctor,
and, pending his arrival, pinioned the raving
patient with his sinewy arms until the man of
intelligent measures took charge of the case. Mrs.
Wayt had run no such risks since.</p>

<p>Her lord never confessed that he took opium or
ardent spirits. Indeed, he made capital of his
total abstinence even from tobacco. There was
always a cause, natural or violent, for his attacks.
The Chicago seizure followed upon his rashness in
swallowing, “mistaking it for mineral water,” a
pint of spirits of wine, bought for cleaning his
Sunday suit. Other turns he attributed, severally,
to dyspepsia, to vertigo, to over-study, and to
extreme heat. A sunstroke, suffered when he
was in college, rendered him peculiarly sensitive
to hot weather. His wife never gainsaid his
elaborate explanations. He was her Percy, her
conscience, her king. She not only went backward
with the cloak of love to conceal his shame, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
she affected to forget the degradation when he
became sober.</p>

<p>Many women in a thousand, and about one
man in twenty millions, are “built so.” The
policy—or principle—may be humane. It is not
Godlike. The All-Merciful calls sinners to repentance
before offering pardon. The Church
insists upon conviction as a preliminary to conversion.
Mrs. Wayt was a Christian and a churchwoman,
but she clung pathetically to belief in
the efficacy of her plan for the reclamation of her
husband. In life, or in death, she would not have
upon her soul the weight of a reproach addressed
to him whom she had sworn to “honor.” Love
was omnipotent. In time he would learn the
depth of hers and be lured back to the right
way.</p>

<p>He was plaintive this forenoon, but not peevish.
His eyes were bloodshot; his tongue was furry;
there was a gnawing in the pit of his stomach and
an unaccountable ache at the base of the brain.</p>

<p>“I have missed another sunstroke by a hair’s
breadth,” he informed his wife. “I almost regret
that we did not go to the seashore. My summer
labors are exhausting the reserves of vital
energy.”</p>

<p>“Why not run down to the beach for a day or
two next week?” suggested Mrs. Wayt. “Now
that your wife is an heiress, you can afford a
change of air, now and then.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>A dull red arose in the sallow cheek. He pulled
her down to kiss her.</p>

<p>“The best, sweetest wife ever given to man!”
he said.</p>

<p>After that he bade her get a little rest. She
must have slept little the night before. Annie
would keep him company. While his head was
so light and his tongue so thick Annie’s was the
best society for him. She made no demand upon
intellectual forces. He sent the best wife ever
given to man off lightened in spirit, and grateful
for the effort he made to appease her anxiety and
to affect the gayety he could not be supposed to
feel. She looked back at the door to exchange
affectionate smiles with the dear, unselfish
fellow.</p>

<p>He watched the baby’s pretty, quaint pretense
of “being mamma,” and hearkened to the drip
and plash of the rain until the gnawing in his
stomach re-asserted itself importunately. He
knew what it meant. It was the demand of the
devil-appetite he had created long ago—his Frankenstein,
his Old Man of the Sea, his body of
death, lashed fast to him, lying down when he lay
down, rising up at his awakening, keeping step
with him, however he might try to flee. The lust
he had courted rashly—now become flesh of his
flesh and bone of his bone.</p>

<p>His wife had carried off the phial of opium.
But he had secreted a supply of the drug for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
emergencies since she had found out the phosphate
device and privately confiscated the stout
blue bottle. He always carried a small Greek
Testament in his hip pocket. Mrs. Wayt’s furtive
search of his clothes every night, after making
sure that he was asleep, had not extended to the
removal of the sacred volume.</p>

<p>He arose stealthily, steadied his reeling head
by holding hard to the back of his neck with one
hand, while the other caught at the chairs and
bed-foot; tiptoed to the closet, found his black
cloth pantaloons, drew out the Testament, and extracted
from the depths beneath a wad of silken,
rustleless paper. Within was a lump of dark
brown paste.</p>

<p>“Tan’y! tan’y!” twittered Annie’s sweet, small
pipe. “Give baby a piece! p’ease, dee papa!”</p>

<p>He hurried back into bed. If the child were
overheard Hetty might look in. And Hester’s
sharp ears were across the hall.</p>

<p>“No, baby; papa has no candy.” He was so
startled and unmanned that he had to wet his
lips with a tongue almost as parched before he
could articulate. “Papa’s head aches badly.
Will Annie sing him to sleep?”</p>

<p>Hester heard, through her stupor of misery, the
weak little voice and the thump of the low rocking
chair as baby crooned to the dolly cuddled in
her arms and to “dee papa,” the song learned
from Hester’s self:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“S’eep, baby, s’eep.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">The angels watch ’y s’eep.</span></div>
<div class="verse">The fairies s’ake ’e d’eamland t’ee,</div>
<div class="verse">An’ all’e d’eams ’ey fall ow’ee.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">S’eep, baby, s’eep!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The rain fell straight and strong. The heavy
pour had beaten all motion out of the air, but the
gurgling of water pipes and the resonance of the
tinned roof gave the impression of a tumultuous
storm. Through the register and chimney arose
a far-off humming from the cellar, where Homer
was “redding up.” Hester’s acute ears divided
the sound into notes and words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“An’ we buried her deep, yes! deep among the rocks.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the banks of the Oma-ha!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Annie stopped singing. “Dolly mus’ lie down
in her twadle, an’ mamma mate her some tea!”
Hester heard her say. At another time she
would have speculated, perhaps anxiously, as to
the processes going on when the clatter of metal
and the tinkle of china arose, accompanied by the
fitful bursts of song and a monologue of exclamations.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! <i>tate tare</i>, dee papa!” came presently
in a frightened tone. Then louder: “Papa!
dee papa! wate up! you’ll det afire!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Wee feet raced across the hall, a round face, red
and scared, appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Hetter! Hetter! tum, wate up dee papa! ’E
bed is on fire!”</p>

<p>Through the doors left open behind her Hester
saw a lurid glare, a column of smoke.</p>

<p>Shrieking for help at the top of her feeble lungs
she plied the levers of her chair and rolled rapidly
into the burning room. Upon the table at the
foot of the bed had stood the spirit lamp and
copper teakettle used by Mrs. Wayt in heating
her husband’s phosphate draughts at night.
Annie had lighted the lamp and contrived to
knock it over upon the bed. The alcohol had
ignited and poured over the counterpane.</p>

<p>Mr. Wayt lay, unstirring, amid the running
flames. Hester made straight for him, leaned far
out of her chair, to pull off the blazing covers,
“Papa! papa! papa!”</p>

<p>He had not heard the word from her in ten
years. He was not to hear it now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayt, Hetty, March Gilchrist, and the
servants, rushing to the spot, found father and
child enwrapped in the same scorching pall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Mr. Wayt died at midnight,” reported the
Fairhill papers. “He never regained consciousness.
The heroic daughter who lost her life in
attempting to rescue a beloved parent lived until
daybreak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘They were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
and in their deaths they were not divided.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I must be going, dear heart!” whispered
Hetty’s namechild, as the August dawn, made
faint by showers, glimmered through the windows.
“I cannot see you. Would Mr. March mind kissing
me ‘good-by’?”</p>

<p>“Mind?” He could not restrain the great sob.
A tear fell with the kiss.</p>

<p>“Dear little friend! my sweet sister!”</p>

<p>The glorious eyes, darkened by death and
almost sightless, widened in turning toward him.
She smiled radiantly.</p>

<p>“Thank you for calling me <i>that</i>. Now, Miss
May! And poor mamma! I wish I had been a
better child to you! Hetty, dearest! hold me
fast and kiss me last of all! You will be very
happy, darling! But you won’t forget me—will
you? I heard the doctors say”—a gleam of the
old fantastic humor playing about her mouth—“that
I had swallowed the flame. I think they
were right—for the—<i>bitterness is all—burned—out—of
my heart!</i>”</p>

<h2>A SOCIAL SUCCESS.</h2>




<h2>PART I.</h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I know</span> it is <i>horrid</i> to swoop down upon you
at this barbarously early hour, but I couldn’t help
coming the minute I received your card. We
get our mail at the breakfast table, and I fairly
screamed with joy when I opened the envelope.
‘Jack!’ I said, ‘<i>who</i> do you think has come to
New York to live?’</p>

<p>“‘The Picanninnies and the Joblillies and the
Garyulies, and probably the grand Panjandrum
himself,’ said my gentleman.</p>

<p>“You know what a tease he is. Oh, no, you
don’t! for you never met him. But you will before
long! ‘Better than all of them put together,
with the little round button on top,’ said I. (You
see I am used to his chaff!) ‘My very dearest
school friend, of whom you have heard me talk
ten thousand times—Susie Barnes, now Mrs.
Cornell. She has been living five years in Brooklyn
(and I’ve always declared I’d rather go to
Canada than to Brooklyn) and here’s her card
telling me that she has returned to civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Mrs. Arthur Hayward Cornell, No. — West Sixty-seventh
St.’ At that he pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“‘That’s the new cashier in the Pin and Needle
Bank,’ says he. ‘Somebody was talking of him
at the Club last night.’ And nothing would do
but I must tell him all about you. In going over
the story and thinking of the dear old times, my
heart got so warm and full that I rushed off by
the time he was out of the house.”</p>

<p>Mrs. John Hitt, a well-dressed, prettyish woman,
whom the cold morning light showed to be also
a trifle society-worn, embraced her hostess anew,
and then held her off at arm’s length for inspection.</p>

<p>“You <i>sweet</i> old girl! what sort of life have you
led that you have kept your roses, your dimples,
and the sparkle in your eyes all these years? Do
you know that you are absolutely bewitching?”</p>

<p>The lately recovered friend smiled, coloring as
a woman of Mrs. Hitt’s world could not have
done.</p>

<p>“You are the same impulsive Kitty!” she said
affectionately. “I have had a quiet, busy, happy
life with Arthur and the children. Three babies
in five years do not give a housekeeper much time
for anything but domestic duties.”</p>

<p>“I should think not, indeed!” The shiver of
shoulders was well-executed, the heavenward cast
of eyes and hands dramatic. “I wonder you live
to tell it! One child in six years has been enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to unsettle <i>my</i> wits. Now that you are once more
within my reach (Oh, you <i>darling!</i>) we must
make up for lost time and see a great deal of each
other! Do you ever sing nowadays? Or have
you let your music go to the dogs? I suppose
so, if Providence <i>has</i> interfered to save your wild-rose
complexion. I was <i>raving</i> to Jack this
morning over the voice you used to have, and
your genius for theatricals and all that. ‘Indeed,’
said I, ‘there was nothing that girl <i>couldn’t</i> do.’
To think of wasting such an organ, or wearing it
thin in crooning nursery ditties.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cornell laughed a soft, merry burst of
amusement, at which the other eyed her curiously.</p>

<p>“You behave less like an exhumed corpse than
anybody could imagine who knew of your five
years in Brooklyn, and the three younglings.
What amuses you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, except your determination to regard
me as dead, buried, and resurrected. So far from
giving up my music, I have practiced more steadily
than if I had spent more evenings abroad.
You know I studied vocal and instrumental music
with the intention of making it my profession.
Arthur agrees with me that what is once learned
should never be lost. Then, when my little girls
are ready to be taught, I can instruct them myself.
We had a number of musical friends in Brooklyn,
and a pleasant circle of acquaintances. We have
not lived in—<i>Hoboken</i>,” cried the hostess in whimsical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
vexation. “I don’t see why New Yorkers
always talk of Brooklyn as if it were as far off and
as much a <i>terra incognita</i> as the moon. We are
inhabitants of the same planet as yourselves.”</p>

<p>The visitor patted the back of her companion’s
hand, soothingly. “You are a New Yorker <i>now</i>—one
of us!” she purred. “In six months you
would as soon cross the Styx as the East River,
even on that overgrown, preposterous Bridge the
Brooklynites give themselves such airs over.
How prettily settled you are!” staring, rather
than glancing about the apartment. “These are
nice drawing rooms and furnished in excellent
taste.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cornell had regarded them as “parlors,”
but her first concession to Mrs. Hitt’s better
knowledge was to look accustomed to the new
term. She fought down with equal success the
impulse to classify Kitty’s open admiration with
the amiable patronage of which Brooklyn people
are inclined to suspect New Yorkers. She plumed
herself modestly upon her taste in house-furnishing
and upon the ability to make cheap things
look as if they had cost a good deal. She had
withheld the fact of the change of residence from
metropolitan acquaintances until her house was
in order that might defy unfavorable criticism.
It was kind in Kitty to run in so unceremoniously
and to be glad of the chance to renew their early
intimacy. In spite of Arthur and the children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
she had begun to be somewhat homesick in the
great whirling world about her.</p>

<p>“Like a chip in the Atlantic Ocean!” Thus
she had described her sensations to her husband
that very morning. “I suppose I shall get used
to it after a while, especially as Brooklyn and New
York are, to all intents and purposes, one and the
same city.”</p>

<p>She asserted it stoutly, knowing all the while
that Moscow and New Orleans were as nearly
homogeneous.</p>

<p>Yes! Kitty was heartily welcome to the
stranger in an unknown territory. Mrs. Hitt was
not intellectual, and judged by standards Arthur
Cornell’s wife had come to revere sincerely, she
was not especially refined in speech and bearing.
Or were Susie’s tastes too quiet and her ideas
old-fashioned, that her interlocutor’s crisp sayings
sounded pert, and the bright brown eyes and
fixed flush upon the cheekbones were artificially
aggressive? Her former chum had always been
warm-hearted, if inconveniently outspoken. And
she was a New Yorker, and fashionable. Susie’s
cherished ambition, unavowed even to Arthur
while it was expedient for them to live simply,
was to be fashionable, brilliant, and courted—a
member in good and regular standing in the
Society of which Mrs. Sherwood lectured, and
Ellen Olney Kirk wrote, and to which Jenkyns
Knickerbocker was <i>au fait</i>. A certain something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that was not air or tone, deportment or
attire, and yet partook of all these as pot-pourri
of rose-breath, spices, and perfumed oils—marked
Kitty Hitt as an <i>habituée</i> of the charmed Reserve.
She was not, perhaps, one of the Four Hundred
selected from the Upper Ten Thousand by processes
as arbitrary, to human judgment, as those
by which Gideon’s three hundred were picked
out from the hosts of Israel. Susie was no
simpleton, albeit ambitious. Mr. Hitt was a
stockbroker; hence manifestly in the line of
promotion, but there were degrees of elevation
upon even Olympus. Her imagination durst not
lift eyes to the cloud-wreathed summit where
chief gods held revel, guarded from vulgar intrusion
by Gabriel Macallister. The climate and
manner of life a few leagues lower down would,
as she felt, suit her better than the rarified atmosphere
of the extremest heights. She had always
meant to climb, and successfully, when time and
opportunity should serve. From the moment
the passage of the river was determined upon as
a business necessity, she felt intuitively that
both of these were near.</p>

<p>“We think them cozy!” she assented quietly
to the visitor’s praise of her rooms.</p>

<p>“Cozy! they are <i>lovely!</i>”</p>

<p>While she talked she raised her eye-glasses to
make note of some fine etchings upon the walls
and a choice water-color upon an easel, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in, in passing, the circumstance that the rugs laid
upon the polished floor were of prime quality,
although neither large nor numerous.</p>

<p>“I do hope you don’t mean to shut yourself up
in your pretty cage as so many pattern wives
and mothers—particularly Brooklyn women”
(roguishly) “do? That’s the reason American
society is so crude and colorless. With your face
and figure and accomplishments (I haven’t forgotten
how divinely you recite) you ought to
become a Social Success—a star in the world of
Society. You ought indeed!” drowning the
feeble murmur of dissent. “There’s many a so-named
leader of the gay world who doesn’t hold,
and who never did hold such a card. Just trust
yourself to me, and I will prove all I promise.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Kitty, I lack the Open Sesame
to the Gotham Innermost—Money! Only the
repeatedly-millionaired can pass the outer courts.”</p>

<p>“There it is! Epigrams and bon-mots drop
from your lips as pearls and diamonds used to
tumble out whenever the good little girl in the
Fairy-tale opened her mouth. As to millions of
money—bah!” with a gesture of royal disdain.
“Our best people are not the richest. The true
New Yorker knows that. Of course one must
live and dress well, but your husband’s means
amply warrant <i>that</i>. Jack says cashiers get from
ten to fifteen thousand dollars a year. Your
face, your manner, and your talents are all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
passport you require when once you are introduced.
I claim the privilege of doing it. And,
as an initial step, I want you and Mr. Cornell to
dine with us to-morrow evening. I’ll ask six or
eight of the nicest people I know to meet you.
They’ll excuse the shortness of the notice when
they see what a reason I have for calling them
together. Put on a pretty gown and look your
loveliest and bring along some music. I mean
that you shall capture all hearts. I shall be
grieved to the quick if you don’t. The hour will
be seven—<i>sharp</i>. Punctuality is the soul of good
humor in a dinner company. I must run away.
I have an appointment with a tyrannical dressmaker
at half-past ten; Mr. Lincoln’s Literature
Class at eleven; a luncheon at half-past one; and
afternoon tea, anywhere from four to six; a
dinner party, and after that the opera. Such a
whirl! Yet, as I say to Jack when he grumbles
that we never have a quiet home evening—it is
the only life worth living, as you’ll own when
you’ve had a taste of it! (You <i>dear</i> thing! it
rests my tired eyes just to look at you!) Here’s
Jack’s card for Mr. Cornell. I’m just dying to
see him and if he is good enough for you.”</p>

<p>“A great deal too good!” ejaculated Susie,
earnestly, through this accidental gap in the
monologue. “The dearest, most generous
fellow!”</p>

<p>“<i>Cela va sans dire</i>—with the Brooklyn model!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I’m so happy that you are one of us, and no
longer a pattern article. Good-by!”</p>

<p>“There! I let her go without showing her the
children,” reflected Mrs. Cornell, when she got
back her breath. “But we had so much to talk
of it is no wonder we forgot them. There are no
friends like the old friends. How unjust we are
sometimes! I came near not sending her my
card because she had never been over to Brooklyn
to see me all the while I was there. And Arthur
advised me against doing it. He would have it
that it is no further from New York to Brooklyn
than from Brooklyn to New York. He predicted,
too, that she would never come to see me
here. He says there’s no other memory so short
as that of a woman who has risen fast upon
the social ladder. This ought to be a lesson in
Christian charity to us both. Kitty’s heart is
always in the right place.”</p>

<p>With a becoming mantling of rose-pink in her
cheeks, she went singing about her “drawing”
rooms, altering the angle of chairs and sofas,
and the arrangement of bric-a-brac, already viewing
her appointments through Kitty’s eye-glasses.
Her thoughts were running upon the projected
dinner party. She was the proud owner of a
black velvet gown with a trained skirt, and a
V-shaped front, and of dainty laces wherewith to
fill the triangle. She had a diamond pin and earrings—wedding
gifts from the wealthy aunt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
whom she was named. The same generous relative
had bestowed upon her, at different holiday
seasons, the rugs and pictures that adorned her
house. Aunt Susan might always be depended
upon to do the handsome thing, and she was
fond of this niece and her “steady” husband.
The home of Susie’s girlhood had been more
plainly furnished, as Kitty had known and must
recollect. It was natural that the elegant grace
characterizing Mrs. Cornell’s abode should mislead
the shrewd observer in the estimate of the
cashier’s income. Without surmising what had
suggested the remark, or that it was a “feeler,”
Mrs. Cornell smiled, yet a little uneasily, in recalling
it.</p>

<p>“Kitty is so used to hearing of big sums that
her ideas are vague on the subject of salaries,”
meditated the better informed wife. “She
doesn’t dream how handsomely people can live
on six thousand dollars. Or that we got along
on one-half that much in Brooklyn and laid aside
something yearly. It is none of my business to
set her right. Arthur doesn’t care to have his
money affairs discussed.”</p>

<p>It did not occur to her as a possibility that
from the pardonable disingenuousness any serious
trouble could ever arise, yet she knew what
Arthur would say. She heard, in imagination,
his warning:</p>

<p>“Never sail under false colors, Susie!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, in her animated description of call
and conversation, she omitted all mention of
Kitty’s tentative allusion to their income. Not
knowing his wife’s old comrade, he might think
her prying and impertinent in touching upon
such a subject at all. Poor, dear Kitty! there
were disadvantages in being so impetuously frank.
A clear-headed cool reasoner like Arthur, for
instance, was almost sure to misread her.</p>

<p>As our heroine had told Kitty, her married life
had been quiet. Her vivacious friend would have
called it “stupid.” The circle of congenial friends
had been circumscribed and most of them were
people of moderate means and desires. Brooklyn
might be called a segregation of neighborhoods,
each district having manners, customs, and social
code peculiar to the village that was its germ.
As one settlement ran into another, a city grew
that claims the respect of the mightier sister
across the river. The Cornells had lived in a
pleasant house in a pleasant street, and Susie had
spoken truly in saying that they lived well. With
no pretense of entertaining, they were cordially
hospitable, “having” friends to supper, or to
pass the evening, whenever fair occasion offered.
For the children’s sake the mother took her
principal meal with them at one o’clock, but the
hearty tea prepared for the father who had
lunched frugally in town was invariably appetizing,
being well cooked and daintily served. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
had the privilege not always accorded to richer
men who sit down daily to late “course dinners”—that
of bringing a crony home with him whenever
he pleased. It was like Arthur Cornell to
choose as chance guests men who had not such
homes as his—bank clerks from the country,
Bohemian artists of good character and light
purses, and the like. Such were the honored
recipients of the hostess’ smile and warm handshake.
She had won the admiring reverence of
more than one homeless bachelor by her skill
in delicate and savory cookery and the gracious
friendliness of her welcome, and these, oftener
than any other class, composed the delighted
audience of the music Arthur called for every
evening.</p>

<p>Once or twice a month husband and wife went
to the theater or a concert, and twice or at the
most three times a year to the opera. They
were pretty sure to have complimentary tickets
to the water-color exhibition and other displays
of paintings in Brooklyn or New York. Of
receptions, they knew comparatively little except
such as followed weddings among their acquaintances.
Neither had ever attended a regular
dinner party gotten up by a professional caterer,
and the ladies’ luncheon of eight, ten, or a dozen
courses was unknown by the seeing of the eyes
and the tasting of the palate to the bright woman
whose social successes in a new arena were foretold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
by the sanguine admirer who craved the
pleasure of bringing her out. There are still in
fast growing American cities tens of thousands
of such people who live honestly, comfortably,
and beneficently, and whose homes are refined
centers of happiness and goodness.</p>

<p>There was, then, cause for the wife’s pleasurable
flutter of spirits and the doubtful satisfaction
expressed, against his intention, in the husband’s
visage at the close prospect of a state banquet
given in honor of their undistinguished selves, at
which anonymous edibles would be washed down
with foreign wines, and spicy <i>entrées</i> be punctuated
by spicy hors <i>d’œuvres</i>. Arthur’s predominant
quality was sound sense, and as his spouse
had anticipated, his first emotion after hearing
her tale was wonder at the sudden and violent
increase of friendship consequent upon their
change of residence, in one who had apparently
forgotten the unimportant fact of her favorite
schoolfellow’s existence for more than five
years.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine why she should care to take
us up now,” he demurred.</p>

<p>Susie’s ready flush testified to the hurt he had
dealt her pride or affections. She thought to the
latter.</p>

<p>“If you would only not let your prejudice
master your reason!” she sighed. “All New
York women hate and dread ferries.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is the Bridge!” put in the Brooklyn-born
literalist.</p>

<p>“Which would have taken visitors <i>miles</i> away
from us. I was afraid you would wet-blanket
the whole affair. I really dreaded to tell you of
what I was silly enough to look forward to with
pleasure. You see you don’t know what a fine,
genuine creature Kitty is. But we won’t dispute
over her or her dinner party. I can write to her
and say that we regret our inability to accept the
invitation.”</p>

<p>Arthur closed his teeth upon another struggling
sentence. Although even less of a society man
than she was of a society woman, he had a definite
impression that invitations to dinner were usually
sent out some days in advance of the “occasion.”
Less distinct, because intuitive, was the idea that
gay young women, already laden with social obligations,
did not press attentions upon everyday
folk from Brooklyn, E. D., unless they hoped to
gain something by it, or were addicted to patronage.
The former hypothesis being, as he conceived,
untenable, it followed that Mrs. Hitt, a
good-natured rattle, must have said more than
she meant of her intentions toward the strangers,
or that she had a native fondness for playing the
lady patroness.</p>

<p>Loving and admiring his wife from the full
depths of a quiet heart, he held all this back.
Susie was vivacious, ready of wit and speech, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
he was not. She dearly enjoyed excitement and
new acquaintances. Give him dressing jacket,
slippers, and an interesting book, or his wife’s
music and his own fireside, and he would not
have exchanged places with Ward Macallister at
his complacent best. Susie would shine anywhere;
she was born to it! He was not even a
first-class reflector of her rays. Yet this noblest
of women had stood by him with cheerful gallantry
in their less prosperous days. He had told
her over and over that she had hidden her light
under a bushel in becoming the mistress of such
a home as he had to give her, but she had loyally
denied this, and borne her part bravely in the
struggle to lap the non-elastic ends of their common
income. To her capital management he
owed much of their present comfort.</p>

<p>Arthur Cornell reasoned slowly, but always in a
straight line.</p>

<p>“I am a selfish, brutal fellow, darling,” he said
at this point of his cogitations. “I am afraid I
am a little tired to-night. We have had a busy
day at the Bank. You mustn’t mind my growls.
When we have had sup—dinner, I would say!—you’ll
find me more than willing to listen and
sympathize.”</p>

<p>Her satisfactory answer was to come over and
kiss him silently, taking his head between her
hands and laying her cheek upon it. The hair
was getting thin on the top, and the gaslight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
brought into gleaming conspicuousness a few gray
hairs. He was older than she by nine years.
It would not be surprising if, for a long time yet,
he continued to say “supper” instead of “dinner.”
She was certain he would never learn to talk of
the “drawing room.” But he was her very own,
and dearly beloved, and the kindest, noblest
fellow in the world. Whatever he might do or
say, she could never be angry with or ashamed
of him.</p>

<h2>PART II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening meal—an excellent one, to which
Mr. Cornell did ample justice—was over. Father
and mother, as was their custom, had visited the
nursery in company, heard the children’s prayers,
and kissed them “good-night.” The orderly
household had settled down into cheerful quiet
that fell like dew upon weary nerves. Susie went
to the piano presently and played a pensive <i>nocturne</i>,
then sang softly a couple of Arthur’s favorite
ballads. The night was blustering, and in the
silence succeeding the music, the wedded pair,
seated before the soft-coal fire in the back parlor,
heard the hurrying tread of passers-by echoing
sharply from the frozen stones.</p>

<p>Arthur ended the restful pause. His choice of
a theme and the lightness of his tone were heroic.</p>

<p>“Low neck and short sleeves for me to-morrow
night, I suppose, old lady? That is to
say, claw-hammer, and low-cut vest. It’s lucky
I had them made for Lou Wilson’s wedding last
winter. There wouldn’t be time to get up the
proper rig, and regrets based upon ‘No dress-coat’
would be rather awkward.”</p>

<p>“Decidedly! No man of whatever age should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
be without one,” rejoined the nascent fashionist.
“Some men never sit down to dinner except in
evening dress. It must be very nice to live in
that way. I like such graceful ceremony in everyday
customs.”</p>

<p>Arthur cast about for something neater to say
than the dismayed ejaculation bitten off just in
time.</p>

<p>“It must help a fellow to feel altogether at his
ease in his company accouterments”—inspiration
coming in the nick of time. “Most men look,
and, judging by myself, feel like newly imported
restaurant waiters when decked out in their
swallow-tails.”</p>

<p>The conventional “dress coat” is a shrewd test
of innate gentlehood. A thoroughbred is never
more truly one than when thus appareled. The
best it can do for the plebeian, who would prefer
to eat his dinner in his shirt-sleeves, is to bring
him up to the level of a hotel waiter.</p>

<p>Arthur looked like an unassuming gentleman
on the following evening, when he joined his wife
below-stairs. If he had not an air of fashion, he
had not a touch of the vulgarian. Susie’s mien
was, as he assured her, that of a queen. Her
head was set well above a pair of graceful
shoulders, she carried herself and managed her
train cleverly. Arthur had brought her a cluster
of pink roses, all of which she wore in her corsage
except one bud which she pinned in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
buttonhole. He put a careful finger under her
chin, and lifted her face to let the full light of the
chandelier rain upon it.</p>

<p>“It would have been a pity to keep you all to
myself to-night,” he said.</p>

<p>The weather was raw, with menace of rain or
snow, but neither of them thought of the extravagance
of a carriage. As she had done upon
previous festal occasions, the wife looped up the
trailing breadths of velvet, and secured them into
a “walking length” of skirt with safety pins.
Over her gala attire she cast a voluminous waterproof,
buttoned all the way down the front. A
bonnet would have deranged her <i>coiffure</i>, and she
wore, instead, a black Spanish lace scarf knotted
under her chin. Slippers and light gloves went
in a reticule slung upon her arm.</p>

<p>It lacked five minutes of seven when they
alighted from a street-car within a block of the
Hitts’ abode. Four carriages were in line before
the door, and from these stepped men swathed in
long, light ulsters, who assisted to alight and
ascend the stone steps apparitions in furred and
embroidered opera cloaks that ravished Susie’s
wits, in the swift transit of the gorgeous beings
from curbstone to the hospitable entrance. A
dizzying sensation of unreality, such as one experiences
in finding himself unexpectedly upon a
great height, seized upon her. Could these people
be collected to meet <i>her?</i> Humbled, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
elated, she entered the house, and obeying the
directions of the footman at the foot of the stairs,
mounted to the dressing room.</p>

<p>Four women in such elaborate toilets that our
heroine felt forthwith like a crow among birds-of-paradise,
glanced carelessly over their shoulders
at her without suspending their chatter to one
another, and went on talking and shaking out
their draperies. Each, in resigning her wraps to
the maids in waiting, stepped forth ready for
drawing-room parade. Susie retreated to a corner
and began hurriedly to disembarrass herself of
her waterproof and to let down her skirt. A maid
followed her presently.</p>

<p>“Can I help you?” professionally supercilious.</p>

<p>“Thank you. If you would be so good as to
take off my boots, I should be obliged.”</p>

<p>The formula was ill-advised and justified the
heightened hauteur of the smart Abigail. With
pursed mouth and disdainful finger-tips, she
removed the evidences that the wearer had
trudged over muddy streets to get here, and as
gingerly fitted on the dry slippers. The heat in
Susie’s cheeks scorched the delicate skin when
she found that the time consumed in her preparations
had detained her above-stairs after everybody
else had gone down. And Kitty had
enjoined punctuality! She met her husband in
the upper hall with a distressed look.</p>

<p>“We are <i>horribly</i> late,” she whispered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it makes any difference,”
responded he to comfort her. “It’s fashionable
to be late, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not at dinners,” she had barely time to
admonish him when they crossed the threshold
of the drawing room.</p>

<p>Kitty advanced with <i>empressement</i> to meet
them, but that they were behind time was manifest
from the celerity with which she introduced
her husband, and without the interval of a second,
the man who was to take Mrs. Cornell in to dinner.
Then she whisked Mr. Cornell up to a dried-up
little woman in pearl-colored velvet, presented
him, asked him to take charge of her into the
dining room, herself laid hold of another man’s
arm, and signaled her husband to lead the way.</p>

<p>Arthur seldom lost his perceptive and reasoning
faculties, and having read descriptions of state
dinners and breakfasts, bethought himself that
had his wife and himself been in truth chief
guests, they would have been paired off with host
and hostess. Moreover, although there was a
vast deal of talking at table and he did his conscientious
best to make conversation with the
velvet-clad mummy consigned to him, he had all
the time the feeling of being left out in the cold.
Nobody addressed him directly in word, or indirectly
by glance, and at length, in gentlemanly
despair of diverting the attention of his fair companion
from her plate to himself, he let her eat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
peace and pleased himself by comparing the rosy,
piquant face of his wife with the bismuth-and-rouge-powdered
visages to the right, left, and front
of her. Susie seemed to be getting on swimmingly.
The man next to her was chatting gayly,
and evidently recognized a responsive spirit in his
fair companion. How easily and naturally she
met his advances, and how gracefully she fitted
into her novel position! What were pomps and
vanities to him accorded with her tastes. Again
he thought how niggardly would have been the
refusal to allow her to take the place she so
adorned.</p>

<p>Not even love’s eye penetrated the doughty
visor she kept jealously closed throughout the
meal. To begin with, she <i>took the wrong fork
for the raw oysters!</i> As course succeeded course,
the dreadful implement, in style so unlike those
left beside other plates, actually <i>grinned</i> at her
with every prong. Everybody must be aware of
the solecism and deduce the truth that this was
her first dinner party. She was sure that she
caught the waiters exchanging winks over the
fork, and that out of sheer malice, they allowed
the tell-tale to lie in full sight. The apprehension
that she would eventually be compelled to use
the frail absurdity or leave untouched something—meat
or game, perhaps—assailed her.
While she hearkened to the flippant nothings her
escort mistook for elegant small-talk, and plucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
up heart for repartee, hot and cold sweats broke
out all over her. Had she obeyed inclination that
approximated frenzy at times, she would have
crept under the table and rolled over on the floor
in anguished mortification. If her sleight-of-hand
had been equal to the rash adventure, she would
have pocketed the wretched bugbear in desperation
akin to that which makes the murderer fling
far from him the weapon with which the deed
was done.</p>

<p>When the ghastly petty torture was ended by
the removal of the obnoxious article, and the substitution
of one larger, plainer, and less obvious,
the poor woman could have kissed the perfunctory
hand that lifted the incubus from her soul.</p>

<p>She made other blunders, but none that were
so glaring as this. Each was a lesson and a
stimulus to perfect herself in the <i>minutiæ</i> of social
etiquette. Before long, she would need no schooling;
would lead, instead of following. She would
know better another time, too, how to dress herself.
Kitty’s gown of cream-colored <i>faille</i>,
flounced with lace; the pale blue brocade of one
woman, and the pink-and-silver bravery of a third,
the maize velvet and black lace of the dowager
across the table, and the mauve-and-white marvel
of still another toilet, threw her apparel into
blackest shade. She caught herself hoping people
would think that she was in slight mourning.
Besides her allotted attendant nobody at table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
spoke a word to her, but Kitty shot many a smile
at her during the feast, and nodded several times
in significance that might be approval or reassurance.
Mr. Hitt, a rather handsome man with
big, bold eyes, looked hard at her now and then,
but did not accost her, even after he grew talkative
under the faster flow of wine. His glasses
were filled so often and emptied so quickly that
Susie wondered to see his wife’s smiling unconcern.
Perhaps she had faith in the strength of
his brain.</p>

<p>Arthur did not touch one of the five chalices of
different shapes and colors flanking his plate, and
Susie was weak enough, perceiving that his conduct
in this respect was exceptional, to feel mortified
by his eccentricity. It was in bad taste, she
thought, to offer tacit censure of the practice of
host and fellow-guests. To nullify the unfavorable
impression of her husband’s singularity, she
sipped from each of her glasses, and dipped so
deeply into the iced champagne which cooled thirst
excited by highly seasoned viands, the heated
room and agitation of spirits, that her bloom was
more vivid when she arose from dinner than when
she sat down. She was quite at ease now, and
enjoying, with the zest of an artistic nature, the
features of the novel scene.</p>

<p>The tempered light streaming over and repeated
by silver, china, and cut-glass; the flower-borders
that criss-crossed the lace table-cover laid over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
rose-colored satin, the superb costumes of the
women and the faultless garments of the men;
the rapid, noiseless exchange of one delicacy for
another, some of the dishes being as new to her
as would have been an <i>entrée</i> of peacocks’ brains
or a <i>salmi</i> of nightingales’ tongues—were fascinating
to one whose love of the picturesque and
beautiful was a passion. This was the sort of
thing she had read of in English novels and
American newspapers, the enchanting mode of
life for which she had yearned secretly, the atmosphere
in which she should have been born.</p>

<p>The return in feminine file to the drawing room
of part of the company was a stage of the pageant
with which <i>Jane Eyre’s</i> life at Thornhill, and
Annie Edwards’ and Ouida’s stories of hospitality
at English country houses had made her familiar.
She hoped nobody else noticed Arthur’s surprised
stare, as the men arose and remained standing,
with no movement in the direction of the escaping
fair ones. With flutter and buzz and silken
rustle, the dames swept through the hall back
into the drawing room and disposed themselves
upon couches and in easy-chairs, where tiny
glasses of perfumed liqueur were handed to them.</p>

<p>“Exactly like a story of Oriental life,” mused
entranced Susie.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, Kitty had the opportunity
to show to her school-friend the pointed
and peculiar attentions the rhapsodies of yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
had authorized her to expect. Up to this
moment nobody had been introduced to her
except the man who took her to dinner.</p>

<p>“I must have you know all these friends of
mine,” she purred, taking Susie’s hand in both of
hers, and leading her with engaging “gush” up
to the mauve-and-white marvel.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Vansittart, this is my <i>dear</i> old school-fellow,
Mrs. Cornell, who is going to play something
for us now, and after a while, to sing several
somethings, and when our audience is enlarged
by the return of the men to us lorn women, she
will, if properly entreated, give us some of her
charming recitations. Ah! you may well look
surprised. It is granted to few women to combine
so many talents, but when you have heard
her, you will see that I do not promise too much.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Roberts!” to the symphony in pink-and-silver—“I
bespeak your admiration for my
friend and school-crony”—etc., etc., until the
blushing <i>débutante</i> was the focus of six pairs of
eyes, critical, indifferent, and amiable, and wished
that dear Kitty were not so incorrigibly enthusiastic
in praising those she loved.</p>

<p>Anyone but a refined novice would have
divined at once that the act of passing her around,
like a plate of hot cakes, argued one of two
things—either that she was a “professional” of
some sort, or that her hostess was lamentably
ignorant of the law demanding that the one to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
honored by an introduction should stand still and
have the other party to the ceremony brought to
her. Kitty, at least, was no novice, and everybody
except her “school-crony” comprehended
exactly what the scene meant. Although she
did not suspect it, she was on trial when she sat
down to the piano, the show-woman beside her,
as the guileless guest supposed, to give her affectionate
encouragement. The first flash of her
fingers across the keys was the signal for general
silence, and the clapping of gloved hands at the
conclusion of the brilliant overture attested intelligent
appreciation. She was not allowed to
leave the music stool for half an hour, one piece
after another being called for, and the choice of
selections putting her on her mettle. Her auditors
were used to good music, and the assumption
that she would gratify them was a delicate compliment.</p>

<p>Kitty came to her elbow at length with a glass
of clear liquid, sparkling with pounded ice.</p>

<p>“Only lime-juice and water,” she whispered,
“to clear your voice. I have praised your singing
until everybody is <i>wild</i> to hear you.”</p>

<p>Susie smiled happily, glancing over her shoulder
with an unconscious and graceful gesture of
gratitude; a bow, slight, but comprehensive, she
might have but had not copied from a popular
prima donna. Another rapid run of the nimble
fingers over the responsive ivory, and she glided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
into the prelude to Gounod’s never-trite song,
“<i>Chantez! Riez! Dormez!</i>”</p>

<p>She had sung but a few bars when her ear
caught the muffled tread of feet in the hall. A
side-glance at the mirror showed her a picture
that might have been clipped from her British
<i>contes de société</i>, the grouping of manly faces and
fashionable dress coats in the curtained arch, all
intent upon herself as the enchantress who held
them mute and eager. Electric fire streamed
through her veins, her voice soared and swelled
as never before; her enunciation, exquisitely pure
and clear, carried each word up to the loftiest
story of the stilled mansion:</p>

<p>“<i>Ah! riez, ma belle! riez! riez, toujours!</i>”</p>

<p>“Fine, by Jove, now!” cried a big mustached
man at Arthur’s side, as the last notes died upon
ecstatic ears. “Patti couldn’t have done it
better!”</p>

<p>The husband repeated this with other encomiums
to the songstress after they got home. He
made the tired but animated little woman sit
down in an armchair and pulled off her rubbers
and unbuttoned her boots in far different fashion
from that in which the sleepy Abigail had put
them on the feet and helped truss up the train of
“the woman who hadn’t come in a carriage like
decent folks.”</p>

<p>He had had a stupid evening. He couldn’t
make the women talk to him. He was not “a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
ladies’ man,” and every mother’s daughter of
them took in the truth at a glance. The men
gabbled over their wine of what did not interest
him, of clubs and horse races, and the fluctuations
of fancy stocks. He neither smoked nor drank,
and was the only man there who did not do both.
His wife’s music was to him the only redeeming
feature of the occasion, and he would have
enjoyed that more in his own parlor. But she
was enraptured with everything and full of delightful
anticipations. “Everybody had been so nice
and kind, and what did ill-natured people mean
by saying there was no real sociability among
fashionable people? For her part, she believed
that the higher one mounted in the social scale
the more genuine goodness and refined feeling
she would find.” Several of the ladies had
promised to call upon her, and, as one said, “to
take her in with them.”</p>

<p>Arthur hearkened silently. He had never been
able to give her such pleasures, a fact that smote
him hard when he saw how zestfully she drank of
the newly opened spring. He would not “wet-blanket”
her enthusiasm, so did not hint at a
discovery made to him by a chance remark of a
guest to the host. Invitations for this particular
dinner party had been out for ten days.</p>

<p>“Then Susie and I were second fiddles,” inferred
the sensible cashier. “I wonder why she
asked us at all!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>




<h2>PART III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cornell’s</span> unspoken suspicion that Mrs.
Hitt would drop her school-friend as suddenly as
she had picked her up was in a way to be falsified,
if the events of the next few months were to be
taken as testimony.</p>

<p>The two matrons were nearly inseparable—shopping,
driving, walking, and visiting together.
For Susie had a New York visiting list speedily,
and almost every name stood for an introduction
by her indefatigable “trainer.” The epithet was
the taciturn husband’s, and, as may be surmised,
was never uttered audibly. Susie’s wardrobe,
furniture, table—her very modes of speech—sustained
variations that amazed old friends and
confounded him who knew her best. The
cherished black velvet she had thought “handsome
enough for any occasion” was pronounced
“quaintly becoming, but too old for the wearer by
twenty-five years.” Slashed and dashed and
lashed with gold-color, it did duty as a house
evening gown. For small luncheons, she had a
tailor-made costume of fawn-colored cloth embroidered
and combined with silk; for “swell”
luncheons, a rich silk—black ground relieved by
narrow crimson stripes, and made en <i>demi-train</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>For at-home afternoons were two tea gowns;
before she received her second dinner invitation,
she had made by Mrs. Hitt’s dressmaker—(“a
Frenchwoman who doesn’t know enough yet to
charge American prices, my dear, and I hold it
to be a sin to <i>throw</i> money away!”) a robe of
white brocade and sea-green velvet, in which garb
she showed like a moss-rose bud, according to her
dear friend and trumpeter.</p>

<p>These strides into the realm of fashion, if at
first startling to the <i>débutante</i>, were quickly
acknowledged to be imperatively necessary if one
would really live. Kitty’s taste in dress approximated
genius. Even she was hardly prepared
for the ready following of her neophyte.</p>

<p>Had she needed corroborative evidence of the
cashier’s liberal income, his wife’s command of
considerable sums supplied it. With all her
frankness, Mrs. Cornell did not confide to her
bosom-friend where she obtained the ready
money that gained her credit with new tradespeople.</p>

<p>Now and then an uneasy qualm stirred the
would-be comfortable soul of the wife as to how
much or how little Arthur speculated within his
sober soul upon the probable cost of her new outfit.
There were two thousand dollars deposited
in her name, and drawing interest in a Brooklyn
Savings Bank. The rich aunt had given her namechild
three-quarters of it from time to time. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
young couple had saved the rest, and it was
tacitly understood that it should not be touched
except of necessity. No landmark in her new
career was more pronounced than Susie’s resort to
this fund for the equipment without which her
dawning social success would, she felt, lapse into
obscurity more ignominious than that from which
she had emerged. She must have the things
represented by the money, and intoxicated though
she was, she had still too much sense and conscience
to deplete her husband’s purse to the
extent demanded by the exigency. He would
have opened an artery to gratify her, had heart’s
blood been coin, but she knew he would look
grave and pained did he suspect her visits to the
Bank and their result.</p>

<p>He was sober enough, nowadays, without
additional cause of discomfort. When questioned,
he averred that all was going right at the Bank,
and that he was well. Nor would he confess to
loneliness on the evenings when she was obliged
to leave him in obedience to Kitty’s summons to
rehearsal or consultation in some of the countless
schemes of amusement the two were all the while
concocting.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself to come for me or to
sit up for me, dear,” the pleasure-monger would
entreat in bidding him “good-by.” “I’ll have
one of the maids call for me,” or “I have a carriage,”
or—and after a time this was most frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of all—“Jack Hitt is always very obliging
about bringing me home.”</p>

<p>With a smile upon his lips and gravity she did
not read in his eyes, he would hand her to the
carriage, or commit her to the spruce maid, hoping
that she would have a pleasant evening, and
having stood upon the steps until she was no
longer in sight, would go back—as she supposed—to
sitting room or book. Whereas, it grew to be
more and more a habit with him to turn into the
nursery instead, and sit there in the dark until he
heard the bustle of her return below-stairs. He
invariably sat up for her—she never asked why
or where. The fire burned cheerily to welcome
her, and the offices of maid, assumed, in the beginning
in loverly supererogation, half jest, half
caress, were now duty and habit. Upon one point
he was resolute. If she went to bed late, she
must sleep late next morning. This was a matter
of health, a concession she owed those to whom
her health was all-important.</p>

<p>The two older children had breakfasted with
their parents for a year, and he made much of
their company when their mother was not the
fourth of the party. Sometimes he sent for the
baby as well, holding her on his knee with one hand,
while the other managed coffee cup and toast.</p>

<p>Susie surprised him thus one morning, having
awakened unsummoned, and dressed hastily that
she might see him before he went out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Arthur Cornell!” The ejaculation was the
first intimation he had of her presence. “You
spoil the children and make a slave of yourself!
Where is their nurse?”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame Ellen, dear!” checking her
motion toward the bell. “I sent for the children.
They are very good, and I enjoy their company.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cornell flushed hotly; her lips were compressed.</p>

<p>“I understand! After this, I will make a point
of giving you your breakfast. It was never <i>my</i>
wish to lie in bed until this hour.”</p>

<p>“It was—and is mine!” rejoined her husband,
steadily, unmoved by her unwonted petulance.
“As it is, you are pale and heavy-eyed. You have
had but five hours of sleep.”</p>

<p>“My head aches!” passing her hand over her
forehead. “That will go off, by-and-by. Baby!
come to mamma, and let dear papa get his breakfast
in peace. Let me pour out a cup of hot
coffee for you, first.”</p>

<p>Her softened tone and fond smile cleared the
atmosphere for them all. Arthur sunned himself
in her presence as a half-torpid bird on an early
spring day. The children prattled merrily in answer
to the pretty mother’s blandishments; the
baby stood up in her lap to make her fat arms
meet behind her neck. She looked pleadingly
into the proud face bent over mother and child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
He was startled to see that the sweet eyes were
misty.</p>

<p>“Dear! can’t you go with me to-night?”</p>

<p>He fairly staggered at the unexpected appeal.</p>

<p>“If I had known——” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know! I ought to have spoken before
you made your engagement. I was careless—forgetful—silly!
I do nothing but silly things nowadays.
But I <i>wish</i> you could go, darling!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s impossible,” said Arthur regretfully.
“The president made a point of my attending
the meeting. I am sorrier than you can be,
little wife.”</p>

<p>She shook her head and tried to laugh.</p>

<p>“That shows how little you know about it!
Don’t make any more engagements without consulting
me. ‘I’m ower young’—not ‘to leave
my mammy yet’—but to be running about the
world without my dear, old, steady-going husband—and
I’m not willing to do it any longer.”</p>

<p>He carried the memory of words and glance
with him all day. Coming home at evening, he
found a note from her, stating that Kitty had
sent for her.</p>

<p>“There is a dress rehearsal at seven,” she
wrote. “I wish you could be there and see how
ravishing I can be! If your business meeting
is over by ten o’clock, won’t you slip into society
toggery and come around in season to see ‘the
old lady’ home?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fever has run its course!” thought the
husband, with kindling eyes. “I knew I should
get her back some day.”</p>

<p>His dinner was less carefully served than in the
olden supper days, but he dined as with the gods,
and ran briskly upstairs to send Ellen down to
her meal while he undressed the children and put
them to bed. He had done this often during the
winter, pretending to make a joke of the disrobing,
but knowing it to be duty and vicarious.
According to his ideas the mother should see to
it in person. No hireling, whose own the bairns
are not, can care for them as those in whose veins
runs answering kindred blood. Usually, the task
was done in heaviness of spirit. To-night, no
effort was required to bring laughter to his lips,
lightness to his heart. To-morrow mamma would
breakfast with them, and resume her place in the
home, so poorly filled by him or anybody else.
She had come back to them. He tried to sing
one of her lullabies as he rocked the baby to
sleep, but failed by reason of a “catch in his
throat.” Mamma would warble it like a nightingale
to them to-morrow night.</p>

<p>The business meeting was unexpectedly brief—“Thanks,”
as the president was pleased to say,
“to the admirable epitome of the matter in hand
prepared and presented by Mr. Cornell.”</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the husband was in his dressing
room, hurrying the process of “slipping into society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
toggery.” He repeated the phrase aloud
while tying his cravat with fingers uncertain from
nervous haste. He was thankful beyond expression
that he had never cast the shadow of his disapproval
over Susie’s spirits, even when they
threatened to carry her out of the bounds of
reason. She was young and pretty; so affluent
of vitality, so richly endowed with talents, that
a humdrum fellow like himself could not comprehend
the stress of the temptation to plunge into
and riot in the mad vortex of social parade.</p>

<p>“If there were any one thing I could do as
cleverly as she does everything, I should be doing
it all the time,” he confessed in contrite candor.</p>

<p>Yesterday he had thanked Heaven that Lent
was close upon the panting racers over the pleasure
grounds. Now, he was indifferent to the
advance and duration of the penitential season.
His darling had returned of her own right-headed,
right-hearted self to the sanctuary of home, having
detected, unaided by his pessimistic strictures,
the miserable vanity and carking vexation of the
hollow system. He sewed two buttons upon his
shirt before he could put it on, and when he
pushed the needle through a hole and the linen
beneath into the ball of his thumb, he began to
whistle “Annie Laurie.”</p>

<p>Susie had practiced “Annie Laurie” for an
hour before dinner yesterday. He wondered if
she had sung it last night at the Hitts’. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
been overrun with business of late, getting ready
for the chamber concert and private theatricals,
and mercy knew what else of frolic and folly
gotten up by Mrs. Hitt for the benefit of the
“Industrial Home” which was the latest charitable
fad in her set. He had paid ten dollars for a
reserved seat last week at the behest of the volatile
Lady Patroness. She had let him have it “at
a bargain because he had the good luck to be
Susie’s husband.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Peltry paid fifty apiece
for theirs, and I made Jack give me thirty for his.
My rooms will seat comfortably just one hundred
and fifty people, and I won’t sell a ticket over
that number at any price. None will be for sale
at the door, and none are transferable. Of course,
the rush for them is <i>fearful!</i>”</p>

<p>Before going Arthur peeped into the nursery,
dropping the most cautious of kisses upon the
cheek and forehead of each sleeper. Three-year
old Sue made up her lips into a tempting knot as
he touched her velvety face.</p>

<p>“Dee’ mamma!” she murmured in her sleep.</p>

<p>He kissed her again for that, the “catch in his
throat” in full possession.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder they love her!” he said brokenly.
“Who could help it?”</p>

<p>The block on which the Hitt mansion stood was
lined with waiting carriages, and Mr. Cornell supposed
that the entertainment, which he called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
himself “a show,” must be nearly over. For an
instant, he meditated waiting without until the
crowd began to pour out, then, making his way
into the hall, to send word to his wife that he
awaited her pleasure. Something in the immobility
of the doors changed his plan. He did not
care to lurk for an hour or more among the coachmen
who stamped and swore upon the pavement,
reminding him of some verses Susie had read to
him in other days when she had time for books
and the talk over them after they were read. He
recalled the first and last verses, and smiled in
going through the discontented ranks and up the
flight of stone steps:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“My coachman in the moonlight there</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looks through the side light of the door;</span></div>
<div class="verse">I hear him with his brethren swear,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">As I could do—but only more.</span></div>
<div class="starbreak">······</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, could he have my share of din,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I his quiet!—past a doubt,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">’Twould still be one man bored within,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And just another bored without.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A surge of hot and scented air enveloped him
with the opening of the door. The crowd in the
hall contradicted the hostess’ declaration that no
more people would be admitted than could be
comfortably accommodated. Struggling up to
the dressing room he got rid of hat and overcoat,
and struggled down again and to the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
rear drawing room. A curtain was rung up from
a stage at the end of the apartment as he gained a
view of it.</p>

<p>The scene was the interior of an old-fashioned
barn. Wreaths of evergreen hung against the
walls and depended from the rafters, and the floor
was cleared for dancing. From a door at the side
a figure tripped into the middle of the stage.
Arthur looked twice before he recognized the
wearer of the colonial gown of old-gold brocade,
brief of waist, and allowing beneath the skirt
glimpses of trim ankles in clocked stockings. Her
hair was piled over a cushion and powdered;
eyebrows and lashes were deftly darkened, and
the carmine of cheek and mouth owed brilliancy
to rouge-pot and hare’s foot. She was the belle
of the ball to be held in the barn, and while waiting
for the rest of the revelers, she began to recite,
in soliloquy, the old rhymes of <i>Money Musk</i>.</p>

<p>At the second line, from an unseen orchestra,
issued low and faint, like the echo of a spent
strain, the popular dance tune. It stole so insidiously
upon the air as to suggest the musical
thought of the soliloquist, and was rather a background
than an accompaniment to the recitative.
Gradually, as the story went on, the lithe figure
began to sway in perfect time to the phantom
music; the eyes, smilingly eager, seemed to look
upon what the lips described; the feet stirred
and twinkled rhythmically; form and face were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
embodied melody. Vivified by reverie, expectant
and reminiscent, the radiant impersonation of the
poet’s picture floated airily through the enchanting
measures. As a morning paper put it, “she
seemed to respire the music to which she swayed
and chanted.”</p>

<p>The audience, “though <i>blasé</i> with much merrymaking
and sight-seeing, hung entranced upon
every motion, until, wafted by gentle degrees
toward the side-scene opposite to that by which
she had entered, she vanished on the last word of
the poem.”</p>

<p>Recalled by a tumult of applause, she courtesied
in colonial fashion, and kissed her hand brightly
to her admirers, but instead of vouchsafing a repetition
of what had stirred the spectators out of
their <i>nil admirari</i> mood, beckoned archly to the
left and right. A troop of young men and girls
obeyed the summons and fell into place in the
country dance that went forward to the now ringing
measures of <i>Money Musk</i>.</p>

<p>The comedietta to which this was the prelude
had been composed by a well-known author, who
was called out at the close of the second act, and
led forward the prima donna of the clever
piece.</p>

<p>The interlude showed a moonlighted dell. On
the distant hilltop was the gleam of white tents;
in the foreground stood a woman as colorless in
robe and visage as the moonbeams. Her voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
silvery and plaintive, thrilled through the crowded
rooms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Give us a song!” the soldiers cried,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The outer trenches guarding,</span></div>
<div class="verse">When the heated guns of the camps allied</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew weary of bombarding.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so, in distinct, unimpassioned narrative up
to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">They sang of love and not of fame,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgot was Britain’s glory;</span></div>
<div class="verse">Each heart recalled a different name,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But all sang “Annie Laurie.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again the invisible orchestra bore up the uttered
words; at first a single cornet bringing down the
air from the tented hilltop; then deeper notes
joining it, like men’s voices of varying tone and
strength, but all singing “Annie Laurie.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Something upon the <i>women’s</i> cheeks</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Washed off the stains of powder.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">said dissonant, derisive tones at Arthur Cornell’s
back, as the curtain fell. “Battered veterans of
a dozen seasons are snivelling like <i>ingenues</i> of no
season at all. What fools New Yorkers are to be
humbugged with their eyes open!”</p>

<p>“The fair manager hath a way of whistling the
tin out of our pockets,” replied a thin falsetto.
“A wonderful creature, that same manager.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>A disagreeable, wheezing laugh finished the
speech.</p>

<p>Arthur made an ineffectual effort to extricate
himself from the packing crowd, a movement unnoticed
or uncared-for by the speakers.</p>

<p>“I admire—and despise—that woman!” continued
the harsh voice. “As an exhibition of
colossal cheek she is unrivaled. For four years
she has preyed upon the majority that is up to
her little ‘dodge,’ and the minority that is <i>not</i>,
pocketing her half of the profits of every ‘charitable’
show; borrowing from innocents that don’t
know that she pays not again, and actually—so I
am told—receiving a commission for introducing
wild Westerners and provincial Easterners into
what she calls ‘our best circles.’ And we go on
buying her tickets and accepting her specimens,
like the arrant asses we are.”</p>

<p>“Madame du Bois, upon a limited scale.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! Madame is her model. Her aping
is more like monkeying, but the resemblance is
not lost. New Yorkers rather enjoy the sublime
audacity of Madame’s fleecing, and she <i>does</i> have
the <i>entrée</i> of uppertendom, sham though she is,
with her drawing-room readings, where geniuses
are trotted out at big prices to ticket buyers, and
no price at all to Madame, and ranchmen’s daughters
are provided with blue-blooded Knickerbocker
husbands. Her schemes are on a large scale.
She engineers benevolent pow-wows, clears her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
one thousand dollars a night, and nobody dare
charge her with pocketing a penny. You can see
where Kit learned her trade. To my certain
knowledge she dresses herself and pays for
all her hospitable entertainments by these
tricks.”</p>

<p>“Her latest investment isn’t a bad notion, but
Kit is working the scheme for all it’s worth.
Anybody but the newest of the new would see
through the game.”</p>

<p>The other laughed gratingly.</p>

<p>“‘New’ is a mild way of putting it. We call
her ‘Kit’s windfall’ at our Club. Madame’s
disciple had, as she fondly imagined, netted a
couple of veritable musical lions, and ten people
were invited to hear their after-dinner roar.
The very day before the feast the male lion fell
sick, and the lioness wouldn’t or couldn’t leave
her mate. Kitty was tearing her false bang over
the note apprising her of the disaster when a
card was brought in, telling her that an old schoolmate
who had been educated as a music-teacher,
and had a niceish talent for recitation, had
removed to the city. Kit caught at the straw;
raced around to inspect her, judged her to be
more than eligible, and roped her in. Delorme
was at the dinner and told me the story, which
his wife had from Kit’s own lips. The new
‘find’ had beauty as well as a voice and a taste
for theatricals, and a neat income, so Kit says—some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
thirty thousand a year. Moreover, she is
tremendously grateful for the lift in the world,
and so daft with enjoyment of her first glimpse
of <i>le bon ton</i> that she would send Kit ten out of
the thirty thousand sooner than lose her social
standing. She doesn’t guess that she will be
tossed aside like a squeezed orange next year,
poor thing!”</p>

<p>Arthur leaned against the door-frame, too
giddy and sick to move, had action been practicable
in such a press. One of the tedious “waits”
inseparable from amateur performances gave
every woman there a chance to outscream her
neighbor. It might be dishonorable not to make
himself known to the gossips who considered
themselves absolved by the payment of an
entrance fee from the obligation to speak well, or
not at all, of their hosts. He did not put the
question to himself whether or not he should continue
to listen. In a judicial mood he would
have weighed the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of fact or fiction
in the tale he had heard. Every word had, to his
consciousness, the stamp of authenticity. In the
shock of the confirmation of his worst misgivings
with regard to his wife’s chosen intimate, his ruling
thought was of the anguish the truth would
cause her. How best to lessen the shock to her
tender, loving heart, how to mitigate her mortification,
began already to put his deliberate faculties
upon the strain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The wiry falsetto and wheezy laugh struck in
from his very elbow.</p>

<p>“Kit’s exemplary spouse may not share her
pecuniary profits, but he has an eye to innings of
another sort. I met him at the Club last night,
and saw that he had about six champagnes and
four cocktails more than his brain could balance.
An hour later, I was passing the house of our
pretty prima donna when a carriage drew up and
out stepped Jack and turned to help out his wife’s
favorite. And, by Jove! the way he did it was
to put his arm about her waist, swing her to the
side-walk and try to kiss her! She espied me, I
suppose, for she broke away from him with a little
screech, and flew up her steps like a lapwing.
She must have had her latchkey all ready, for she
got the door open in a twinkling, and slammed it.
I guffawed outright, and didn’t Jack swear!”</p>

<p>“What a beastly cad he is!” said the deep
voice disgustfully.</p>

<p>Few men in the circumstances would have kept
so forcibly in mind the shame to wife and children
that would follow a blow and quarrel then
and there, as the commonplace husband upon
whose ear and heart every vile word had fallen
like liquid fire. He rent a path through the
throng, got his hat and coat and went out of the
abhorrent place. He had seen to it that Susie’s
hired carriage was always driven by the same
man—a steady, middle-aged American—and recognizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
him upon the box, signaled him to
draw up to the sidewalk, stepped into the vehicle,
and prepared to wait as patiently as might be
until the man’s number should be called by the
attendant policeman.</p>

<p>The “show” was not over for an hour longer,
and his carriage was the last called. The fair
manager had detained her lieutenant to exchange
felicitations over the triumph of the evening.
Susie appeared, finally, running down the steps so
fast that her attendant only overtook her at the
curbstone. He had come out bareheaded, and
without other protection against the bitter March
wind than his evening dress and thin shoes. Mrs.
Cornell’s hand was on the handle of the carriage
door, and he covered it with his own.</p>

<p>“Are you cruel or coquettish, sweet Annie
Laurie?” he asked in accents thickened by liquor
and laughter.</p>

<p>By the electric light Arthur saw the pale terror
of her face, as she tried to wrest her fingers from
the ruffianly grasp. Without a second’s hesitation
the husband leaped out through the other
door, passed behind the carriage, lifted the man,
taller and heavier than himself, by the nape of the
neck, and laid him in the gutter.</p>

<p>“The fellow is drunk!” he remarked contemptuously
to the policeman who hastened up,
imagining that the gentleman had tripped and
fallen. “It is lucky you are here to look after him.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>He handed his trembling wife into the carriage,
swung himself in after her, and bade the coachman
drive home.</p>

<p>Then—for as I have expressly affirmed, this
man was heroic in naught save his love for wife
and children—he put strong tender arms about
the sinking woman, who clung to his neck, convulsed
by sobs, as one snatched from destruction
might hang upon the saving hand.</p>

<p>“There, my darling! It is all over! I ought
to have taken better care of you. The old account
is closed. We’ll begin another upon a clean
page.”</p>

<p>He was only a bank cashier, you see, and familiar
with no figures except such as he used every
day.</p>

<h2>THE ARTICLES OF SEPARATION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> and since the day when a certain man—idling
while Israel and Syria warred—drew a
bow at a venture (the margin has it, “in his simplicity,”)
that let a king’s life out, the air has
vibrated to the twang of other bowstrings, and
millions of barbs, as idly sent, have been dyed
with life-blood.</p>

<p>In every 50,000 cases of this sort of manslaughter,
49,999 fall by the tongue.</p>

<p>The Hon. Simeon Barton, radiating prosperity
from every pore of his snug person, and
clothed with complacency as with a garment,
rolled about the soon-to-be-vacated bachelor quarters
of his nephew-namesake, thumbs in armholes,
and chin in air, while he discoursed:</p>

<p>“You’re a pluckier fellow than your uncle, me
boy! Of course, it is on the cards that your head
may be level. There are literary women <i>and</i>
literary women, no doubt, and this must be a
favorable specimen of the tribe, or you wouldn’t
have been in your present fix, but none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
lot in mine, if you please. When my turn comes—and
I aint sure that I shan’t look out for a
match some day, when I am too stiff to trot well
in single harness, I shall hold the reins. No inside
seat for me.”</p>

<p>The nephew laughed in a hearty, whole-souled
way. He was not touched yet.</p>

<p>“You mix your figures as you do your cobblers—after
you get hold of the sherry bottle—with
a swing. Wait until you see my ‘match.’
She is a glorious woman, Uncle Sim. The wonder
is that she ever got her eyes down to my level.”</p>

<p>The forty-year-old celibate continued to roll and
harangue. His dress coat was new and a close fit
to his rotund dapperness; with one lavender
glove he smote the palm of his gloved left hand;
the rose in his buttonhole was paler than the
hard red spots on cheeks like underglazed pottery
for smoothness and polish, his mustache curled
upward and wriggled at animated periods.</p>

<p>“Quite the thing, me dear boy, altogether
proper. For me part, I wouldn’t care to be under
obligations to a woman when she <i>had</i> worked
down to my level, but tastes differ, and a man of
twenty-six who has a living to make ought to cast
an anchor to windward, in case of squalls. A
woman who can chop a stick, at a pinch, to set
the pot to boiling is a convenience. Literature’s
a better trade now than it used to be, I suppose.
Jones of Illinois was telling me last night of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
prices paid to good selling authors, and by
George! I was surprised. All the same, I’d fight
shy of the Guild if I were contemplating matrimony.
If you could see some of the many
objects that hang about the Capitol in wait for
Tom, Dick, or Harry to pick up a ‘personal,’ or
lobby a bill, or get subscriptions to a book or
magazine, you wouldn’t wonder at my ‘prejudice,’
as you are pleased to style it. Pah!”</p>

<p>To rid his mouth of the taste he caught up a
tumbler of sherry cobbler, filmy without and icy
amber within, and drained it.</p>

<p>The expectant bridegroom glanced at the
clock. His best man was to call for him at a
quarter-past seven. It was exactly seven now,
and the minutes drove heavily.</p>

<p>“But Uncle Sim,”—still good-humoredly,—“Miss
Welles is not a newspaper reporter, nor a
lobbyist, nor yet a penny-a-liner. She wrote to
please herself and her friends until her father’s
death, six years ago. He was considered fairly
wealthy, but something went wrong somewhere,
and his widow would have suffered for the want
of much to which she had been accustomed but
for the talents and courage of her young daughter.
I am afraid the poor girl worked harder than
her mother suspected for a while, although the
public received her favorably from the outset.
Mrs. Welles survived her husband three years.
Agnes then went to live with her only sister, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Ryder, the wife of my partner. I first met her at
his house. She has continued to write and has
supported herself handsomely in this way. She
is as heroic as she is sweet—a thorough woman.”</p>

<p>“With a masculine intellect! I comprehend,
me boy. Don’t multiply epithets on my account.
As I’ve said, I don’t presume to question the
wisdom of your choice in this particular case, and
that your inamorata is the best of her kind, but
personally, I don’t take to the <i>kind</i>. By Jupiter!
I was telling Jones of Illinois, last night, of an
incident that gave me a ‘scunner’ against woman
authors, twenty years ago. Mrs. Shenstone of
New York was a literary light in her day. There’s
a fashion in writers, as in everything else, and she
went out with balloon skirts and <i>chig-nongs</i>.
But she was a star of the first magnitude in her
own opinion, and, at any rate, something in the
stellar line in others’ eyes. Her husband had
money and she was a poor girl when she married
him. They say he made a show of holding his
own while the shekels lasted. A more meek-spirited
atomy I never beheld than when they
called upon my friends, Mr. and Mrs. Lamar
from Charleston, then staying at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, one evening, when I chanced to be sitting
with the Lamars in their private parlor. And as
sure as I am a sinner and you’re another, the card
brought in to Mrs. Lamar was ‘Mrs. Cordelia
Shenstone <i>and husband</i>.’ The last two words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
were added in pencil. Fact, ’pon honor! Mrs.
Lamar carried the card home and had it framed
as a domestic and literary curiosity.”</p>

<p>“You cite an extreme case”—another glance
at the slow clock. “If that woman had been a
shopkeeper, or a dressmaker, with the same arbitrary,
selfish spirit, she would have been guilty of
the same gross violation of taste and feeling.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so! maybe so! But the writing
woman is a prickly problem in modern society.
She is leading the van in all revolutionary rot
about women’s wrongs and women’s rights. The
party can’t do without her, for the rank and file
couldn’t draft a resolution or write a report to
save their lives, and they’ve flattered up our blue-stocking
until she steps out of all bounds. It
makes a conservative patriot’s blood run cold to
think what the upshot of it all is to be. And I
confess I don’t like to anticipate seeing your cards
engraved—‘Mrs. Clytemnestra Ashe and husband.’”</p>

<p>A dark red torrent poured over the listener’s
face. Physically and morally, he was thin-skinned.</p>

<p>“There is nothing of the Clytemnestra in her
make-up, sir. No woman ever made could rule
me, were she my wife. Agnes is too gentle and
too sensible to attempt it. As to the cards!”
He went to a drawer and took out a bit of pasteboard
which he tossed to his kinsman, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
derisive laugh. “That is all settled, you see.
Come in!” to a knock at the door.</p>

<p>When the tardy best man appeared, the Hon.
Simeon Barton, his head on one shoulder, and
eyes half shut, after the manner of an impudent
cock-sparrow, was scanning the engraved inscription,</p>

<div class="bbox"><br />
<span class="smcap">Mr. and Mrs. Barton Ashe</span>,<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">170 West —— St.</span><br />
<br />
</div>

<p>“Leave the ‘Simeon’ out, do you? Clytem—<i>Agnes</i>
doesn’t like it, maybe?” And without
waiting for a reply—“Good-evening, Mr. White.
I’m just advising Bart here to use up this batch
of cards plaguey quick, to make room for ‘Mrs.
Ashe <i>and husband</i>.’”</p>

<p>Mr. White laughed a little and politely. The
jest was in miserable taste, but much was pardonable
in rich uncles who were self-made men, when
they showed a disposition to help make their
nephews. A glimmer of like reasoning may have
entered Barton’s mind, for he turned an unshadowed
brow to the eccentric millionaire.</p>

<p>“When that time comes I shall employ you
to draw up the articles of separation. White,
here, is witness to the agreement.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour later, he would not have believed the
words had passed his lips. Jest upon such a
horror would have seemed profanation to the
newly made husband. As the woman who would
never again answer to the name of Agnes Welles
stood beside him, his were not the only eyes that
paid silent homage to her strange beauty—strange,
because to the guests, and to the assembled relatives,
this phase of one whom most people had
hitherto thought only “interesting” and “pleasing,”
was new and unexpected. She was but a
few inches shorter than her manly partner, and
slender to fragility. Straight and supple as a
willow-wand, she was ethereal in grace when clad
in the misty robes and veil which were the wedding
gift of her godmother. Her dark eyes were
full of living light, illumining the colorless face
into weird loveliness, that belonged neither to
feature nor complexion. The short, tense bow of
the upper lip, the fine spirited line of the nostrils,
the perfect oval of cheek and chin, were always
high-bred—some said, haughty. To-night they
were chastened into lofty sweetness that was pure
womanly.</p>

<p>“She might pass for <i>twenty</i>-two,” said an audaciously
young <i>débutante</i> to a crony just behind
Mr. Barton.</p>

<p>And—“By George!” thought that astute individual—“the
young dog never hinted that his
divinity was six years his senior. I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
been surer than ever of receiving that card.
Pity! pity! pity! <i>That’s</i> a fault that won’t mend
with time.”</p>

<p>Agnes knew better than he could have told her
what risks the woman takes who consents to marry
her junior in years. Early in their acquaintanceship
she had contrived to apprise Barton of this
disparity. When he declared his love she set
it boldly in the foreground of hesitation and
demur.</p>

<p>“When you are thirty-five, in man’s proudest
prime and yet far from the comb of the hill, I
shall have begun to go down the other side,” she
urged. “You might be able to contemplate the
contrast boldly, but could I forgive myself?
There may be a suspicion of poetry—pathetic but
real—in the idea of an old man’s darling, but an
old woman’s pet! <i>that</i> is a theme no painter or
poet has dared to handle. The suggestion of
grotesqueness is inevitable. Both are to be pitied,
but I think the wife needs compassion even more
than the man she has made ridiculous.”</p>

<p>The rising young lawyer was a clever advocate,
and he had never striven longer and harder to
win a cause. When his triumph was secured
Agnes could not quite dismiss the subject. It
haunted her like a wan ghost, with threatening
beck and ominous eye. Once, but a month before
their wedding day, they were speaking of George
Eliot’s singular marriage with a man young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
enough to be her son, and an abrupt change fell
upon Agnes’ visage—a shade of painful doubt
and misgiving.</p>

<p>“Dinah Maria Mulock, too!” she exclaimed.
“And Mme. de Staël! Elizabeth Browning’s
husband was some months younger than she.
Then, there are Mrs. —— and Mrs. ——” naming
two prominent living American authors. “How
very singular! There must be some occult reason
for what we cannot set down as coincidences. It
looks like fatality—or” hesitatingly—“infatuation.”</p>

<p>“Rather,” said Barton in gentle seriousness, for
her perturbation was too real for playful rallying—“attribute
such cases to the truth of the eternal
youthfulness of genius. These men see in the
faces and forms of the women they woo, the
beautiful minds that will never know age or
change. Time salutes, instead of challenging
those high in favor with the king.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” Agnes said, her slim white
hand threading the brown curls of the head she
thought more beautiful than that of Antinous—“that
you will never say a more graceful thing
than that? You are more truly a poet than I.
Don’t disclaim, for I am not a bard at all. When
I drop into poetry <i>à la</i> Wegg, it is <i>not</i> ‘in the light
of a friend.’ When I am in the dark or at best
in a half-light, sorry or weary, or lonely of heart,
my thoughts take rhythmic shape. They are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
homely little crickets, creeping out in the twilight
to sing by the fire that is beginning to gather
ashes. I am a born story-teller, but I deserve no
credit for that. Something within me that is not
myself tells the stories so fast that I can hardly
write them down as they are made. I am no
genius, dear. Don’t marry me with that impression.
I wish for your sake that I were. How
gloriously proud you would be of me!”</p>

<p>“I am ‘gloriously proud’ of you now!” He
said it in fervent sincerity. “If you have genius,
don’t develop it. I can hardly keep you in sight
as it is.”</p>

<p>Dimly and queerly, the feeling that prompted
the half-laughing protest returned upon him to-night.
The solemn radiance overflooding her
eyes and clearing into exalted beauty lineaments
critics pronounced irregular, positively awed him—an
uncommon and not altogether agreeable sensation
for a bridegroom, especially one of his
practical and somewhat dogmatic cast of mind.
Rebel though romantic lovers may at what they
consider derogatory to the constancy and depth
of wedded affection, it is not to be denied that
the turn of the bridal pair from the altar symbolizes
a reversal in their mutual relation. The
bonds that have held the lover in vassalage—very
sweet bondage, perhaps, but still not liberty—are
with the utterance of the nuptial benediction
transferred to the woman he holds by the hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Barton Ashe was very much in love, but he was
a very man. His wife was now his property.</p>

<p>“I feel a wild desire to put my arms around
you to keep your wings from unfurling,” he found
occasion to whisper presently. “I suppose these
people would think me insane if I were to yield
to the impulse and tell them why I did it.”</p>

<p>The luminous eyes laughed joyously into his.
With all her intellect and passionate depth of
feeling, she had seasons of childlike glee that
became her rarely.</p>

<p>“As you would be. I was never farther from
‘wanting to be an angel’ than at this instant.
The life that now is appears to me eminently
satisfactory.”</p>

<p>A fresh bevy of congratulatory guests interrupted
the hasty “aside.”</p>

<p>“We find it hard to forgive you, Mr. Ashe,”
twittered an overdressed, overcolored, and overmannered
spinster. “How can you reconcile it
to your conscience to change a broad, beneficent
river into a canal to serve your own particular
mill? I shall not congratulate you upon a private
good which is a public disaster.”</p>

<p>“Many others are thinking the same thing, but
they cannot express it so beautifully,” said a
plaintive matron, one of the many whose perfunctory
sighs at weddings are the reverse of complimentary
to their bonded partners. “But we
must be thankful you have been spared so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to make us happy and do so much good in the
world.”</p>

<p>“I am puzzled,” Barton observed, looking from
one to the other. “If I were taking her out of
town, to Coromandel, we will say, or even to
New Jersey, there might be occasion for outcry.”</p>

<p>“You are robbing us of the better part of this
woman,” interrupted the hortatory spinster in
a dramatic contralto. “My protest is in the
name of those to whom she belonged by the
right the benefited have to the benefactor, before
you crossed her path, in an evil hour for the
world. It passes my comprehension, and I know
much of the arrogant vanity of your sex, how any
one man can hope to make up to his author wife
for the audience she resigns when she sits down to
pour out his coffee and darn his socks for the rest
of her mortal existence. It is breaking stones
with a gold mallet to make a mere housekeeper
out of such material as this,” lightly touching the
head crowned by the bridal veil. “But my imagination
is not of the masculine gender.”</p>

<p>“Don’t strain it needlessly,” smiled Agnes,
before the attacked person summoned wit for
a retort. “Soup-making is a finer art than writing
essays, to <i>my</i> comprehension, yet I hope to
learn it.”</p>

<p>The matron put in her sentence, sandwiched
between sighs.</p>

<p>“You will find the two incompatible. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
married, a woman’s life is merged in that of another.
She has no volition, no thought, no name
of her own.”</p>

<p>“The married woman does not possess herself!”
cried the spinster in shrill volubility.
“She effaces her individuality in uttering the
promise to ‘serve and obey’—vile words that
belong rather to the harem of the sixteenth century
than to the home of the nineteenth. Somebody
else has reported me in yesterday’s <i>World</i>
and <i>Herald</i>, so I may as well tell you that I
brought forward a motion in Sorosis last Monday,
that the club should wear crape upon the left
arm for thirty days, dating from this evening, in
affectionate memory of one of our youngest and
most brilliant members. Talk of the self-immolation
of the Jesuit who changes the name his
mother gave him and resigns the right of private
judgment and personal desire in joining the
Order! He is riotously free by comparison with
the model wife. Her assumption of the conventual
veil is mournfully symbolical.”</p>

<p>Another wave of newcomers swept her onward,
still hortatory and gesticulatory.</p>

<p>She was never spoken of again by the bridal
pair until the marriage day was a fortnight old.</p>

<p>They were pacing the wooden esplanade in
front of the Hygeia Hotel at Old Point Comfort,
basking in the December sunshine. The sea air
had set roses in Agnes’ cheeks; her lips were full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and red, her eye sparkled with soft content, and
her step was elastic. Barton, surveying these
changes with the undisguised satisfaction of a
man who has secured legally the right to exhibit
his prize, took his cigar from his mouth to say
carelessly:</p>

<p>“By the way, I have never asked the name of
the painted-and-powdered party who gave a parlor
lecture upon Jesuits and harems the night we
were married.”</p>

<p>“It was Miss Marvel,” said Agnes, laughing.
“She is an eccentric woman, and as I need not
tell you, indiscreet and flippant in talk, letting her
theories and spirits run away with her judgment.
But she accomplishes a great deal of good in
her way and has many fine traits of character. It
is a pity she does herself such injustice.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Does she belong to the sisterhood
of letters?”</p>

<p>“In a way—yes. Her articles upon the Working
Girls of New York, written for newspaper
publication two years ago, attracted so much attention
that they were collected into a volume last
summer.”</p>

<p>“She is a member of Sorosis—I gather from
her tirade?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. One of the oldest members.”</p>

<p>“What a hotch-potch that society or club—or
whatever you may choose to call it—must be!
Do you know, darling, I never associate you—or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
any other true, refined woman with the crew to
which you nominally belong? You are a lily
among thorns in such a connection. I should
rather say among thistles and burdocks and
stramonium and the like rank, vile-smelling
weeds.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for the pretty praise of myself,”
smiling sweetly and fondly at him. “But I cannot
accept it at the expense of fairer flowers than
I can ever hope to be, true, strong women who
are trying to help their sex to a higher plane and
prepare them for better work than they have
yet accomplished, in spite of the limitations of
sex—”</p>

<p>He caught her up on the word.</p>

<p>“Don’t fall into their cant, for Heaven’s sake!
The ‘limitations of sex’ are woman’s crown of
glory. I have done some sober thinking lately—especially
since the drubbing received from your
Miss Marvel—with regard to the mooted subject
of the emancipation of women, falsely so called.
My conclusions may not coincide with your views
upon the subject. But, perhaps you do not care
to discuss it?”</p>

<p>Her face was sunny; her look at once fearless
and confiding.</p>

<p>“We are both reasonable people, I hope. If
we are not, we love each other too well not to
agree amicably upon unavoidable disagreements.”</p>

<p>Barton tossed his cigar stump into the foam of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the nearest wave; a touch of impatience went
with fling and laugh.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that like a woman? She presupposes
disagreement and forestalls argument by pledging
herself to forgive for love’s sake whatever she
will not admit. The wisest and best of the sex—and
you are both of these—will press feeling into
what should be impersonal debate. Perhaps it is
safer to talk of other things. See that gull swoop
down and come up empty-clawed. That is his
fourth unsuccessful trip to market within thirty
minutes. The <i>passée</i> belle upon the pavilion over
there has had that rich youngling in tow twice as
long. I will wager a pair of gloves against a
buttonhole bouquet with you that she doesn’t
land him.”</p>

<p>Neither tone nor manner was pleasant. Agnes
laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Won’t you go on with what you were about
to say? I may not be able to argue. I think,
with you, that logic is not woman’s forte. Perhaps
we may learn, with time and education, to
divorce thought and feeling. But I am a capital
listener, and a willing learner.”</p>

<p>“You are an angel”—pressing the hand to his
side, “and so far above Miss Marvel and her
compeers in intellect and breeding that I fret at
the alleged partnership. This talk of woman’s
serfdom and the need of elevating her, mentally
and politically, is stuff from first to last. Vile and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
pestilential stuff! Heresy against the teachings
of Nature and of Him who ordained that man
should be the superior being of the two. Those
who are pressing forward in what they call Reform
of Existing Wrongs are your worst enemies.
You should need no champion but your other
self, Man. In arraying one sex against the other,
you antagonize him. I see this rampant attitude
of woman everywhere and hourly. If a man
resigns his seat in a public conveyance to a
woman, she takes it arrogantly—not gratefully.
She pushes him aside with sharp elbows in crowds,
jostles him upon gangways, presses before him
into doors, always with a ‘good-as-you’ air
which exasperates the most amiable of us. Her
voice is heard in debating societies; she sits
beside man upon the rostrum; competes with
him in business, often successfully, because she
can live upon less than he. The devilish spirit
of revolt permeates all grades of society. The
home—God’s best gift to earth—has no longer a
recognized governor, no judge to whom appeal is
final. Sisters wrangle with brothers for equal
educational advantages, instead of making home
so pleasant that boys will be content to stay
there. Women’s Clubs, Women’s Congresses,
Women’s Protective Unions, are part and parcel
of the disunion policy. Instead of refining man
this is surely, if slowly, arousing the latent savage
in him. When that does spring to action, let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
weaker sex beware. Outraged natural laws will
right themselves in the long run, but sometimes
at fearful cost.”</p>

<p>Agnes was perfectly silent during this harangue,
ignorant as was he of his resemblance to pudgy
and pompous Uncle Simeon, while he beat the
palm of the right hand with the empty left-hand
glove, and rolled slightly from one leg to the
other in the slow promenade. The bloom gradually
receded from her cheeks, her profile was
still and clear as a cameo. Her eyes were directed
toward the gray-blues of the meeting line of wave
and sky. Once she glanced up to follow the gull,
rising from a fifth unsuccessful dip.</p>

<p>Presently she halted and leaned upon the parapet
to watch the half-consumed cigar, swinging
and bumping like a truncated canoe in the foam-fringes
of the rising tide. Barton stopped with
her without staying his talk. An impulse born of
the innate savagery he imputed to his sex, bore
him on. His wife’s very impassiveness irked him.
Silence was non-sympathetic; white silence, like
hers, chilling. Irritation, engendered by piqued
vanity, does not withhold the home-thrust because
the victim is dearly beloved.</p>

<p>“You do not like to hear me talk in this strain,”
he pursued. “It is only natural that a woman of
independent thought and action, accustomed to
adulation, and to whom the excitement of a public
hearing for whatever she has to say has become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
necessity of existence; who has looked beyond
the quiet round of home interests and home
loves for a career; who has fed her imagination
upon unreal scenes and situations—should——”</p>

<p>He could get no further. Fluent as he was in
speech, he had wound himself up in nominative
specifications, and the verb climax failed him unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Should—what?” said Agnes, turning the set,
tintless visage toward him. Her eyes, blank and
questionless, showed how far from her thought
was sarcastic pleasure in his discomfiture. Barton
was too much incensed to reason.</p>

<p>“Should—and <i>does</i> sneer at her husband’s
serious talk upon a matter in which, as he is fast
discovering, his happiness is fatally involved!”</p>

<p>“<i>Fatally!</i> O Barton!”</p>

<p>Independent and strong-minded she might be
to others, but he had hurt her terribly. The
stifled cry took all her strength with it. She
caught at the railing for support, and leaned upon
it, sick and trembling.</p>

<p>He lifted his hat in mock courtesy.</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me I will continue my walk
alone. It is useless to attempt the temperate
discussion of any subject when my words are
caught up in that tone and manner. May I take
you back to the hotel?”</p>

<p>Agnes straightened herself up. Her color did
not return, but her voice was her own. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
always a peculiar and vibrant melody, and her
articulation was singularly distinct for an American
speaking her own language.</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me. I did not mean to
be abrupt, much less rude. If I seemed to be
either or both I ask your forgiveness. You need
not trouble yourself to escort me to the hotel. I
will sit here for a while and then go in. I hope,
when you think the matter over dispassionately,
you will see that I could not be guilty of what
you imply.”</p>

<p>He strode off toward the Fort, the deep sand
somewhat derogatory to dignity of carriage, but
favoring the increase of irritability. Agnes strolled
slowly along the beach until she found a lonely
rock upon the tip of a tongue of bleached sand,
where she could sit and think out the bitterest
hour she had ever known. People, passing upon
pier and esplanade, saw her there all the forenoon,
a slight figure whose gray gown matched
in color the stones among which she sat, as
motionless as they. The brackish tide rose slowly
until the spray sprinkled her feet, whispering
mournful things to rock and sand. She saw and
heard nothing, while her eyes seemed to follow
the stately sail and swoop of the gulls whose
breasts showed whitely against the blue of the
December sky.</p>

<p>Other wives than Lorraine Loree have wedded
men of high degree only to find that “husbands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
can be cruel,” and more than Lorraine or Agnes
dreamed of have made the discovery before the
wane of the honeymoon.</p>

<p>This bride felt bruised and beaten all over, and
suffered the more, not less, for her sorrowful
bewilderment as to the exact cause of this, the
first quarrel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> women and many men are compounded
and shaped into sentient beings without the infusion
of so much as a pennyweight of tact.</p>

<p>Many women and a few men combine with this
deficiency—which is, in itself, a deformity—a fatal
facility for saying exactly the wrong thing when
the wrong thing will do most harm.</p>

<p>Miss Marvel had taken all the honors in this
line which native bias and feminine fussiness could
win, and she wove a new spray into her laurel
wreath one day in the March succeeding the
winter in which Barton Ashe and Agnes Welles
were made one—in law and gospel.</p>

<p>The morrow would be his wife’s birthday, and
Barton had in his breast pocket a tiny box containing
a sapphire ring for her, when he arose to
resign his seat in the street car to the dashing
spinster, whom he recognized as soon as she entered.
He had never seen her since his wedding
eve, but she was not a woman to be forgotten or
overlooked. She was in great force to-day, gorgeously
appareled and flushed beyond high-rouge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
mark by three hours at a literary breakfast, given
at Delmonico’s to a distinguished foreigner.</p>

<p>“I am surcharged with electric thought,” she
confided to Mr. Ashe when she had taken the
vacated place with a cavalier nod that might mean
“Thanks,” or “That’s only decent, my good
man.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Barton, in naïve wonderment, for
the want of anything else to say.</p>

<p>“Surcharged! bristling! I could fancy that at
the approach of the negative pole I should crackle
and emit sparkles like a brisk battery. Such a
feast of intellect! such flow of soul! such scintillating
wit! Three hours of such intercourse were
worth ten—a thousand cycles of Cathay. Our
guest was superb! such dignity and such graciousness
of affability as can only coexist in an Old
World product.”</p>

<p>She spoke loudly, after the manner of the New
World product (<i>genus homo</i>, feminine gender).
Several solid men peered at her around or over the
evening papers. Two giddy girls, who had taken
without thanks or scruples seats from weary men,
smiled undisguisedly. Barton, standing in the
aisle, holding on by the strap, his knees abraded
by the jet passementerie of Miss Marvel’s velvet
skirt, could not budge an inch. He must hear
and, hearing, essay reply of some sort. “Ah!”
albeit the safest and most commodious monosyllable
in the language, cannot go on forever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“The lunch was largely attended, I suppose?”
he ventured in tones studiously lowered.</p>

<p>“By every woman in New York who is worth
the notice of an intelligent being. With one distinguished
exception. Mrs. Ashe’s absence was
the occasion of universal regret. As a well-wisher
let me warn you that you may be mobbed some
day for your unconscionable cruelty to the highest
order of created things; for imprisoning the eagle
and stilling the song of the lark. At least fifty
people asked me to-day why Agnes Welles had
disappeared from the literary firmament. For one
and all, I had one and the same reply. ‘She has
taken the bridal veil,’ I said, tears in eyes and
voice. ‘In consequence of that piece of barbarity,
and for no other cause, the places that once knew
her know her no more.’ One woman—I won’t
divulge her name, lest you should <i>hate</i> her—said
she ‘should as soon think of chaining a
thrush to the leg of a kitchen chair as of
obliging that glorious young thing to resign
her Heaven-appointed mission for the position
of caterer, housekeeper, and seamstress.’ I
shall work that <i>bon mot</i> into my next literary letter
to the Boston <i>Globe</i>. Another delightfully
satirical creature advised me to take up the cause
of ‘Great Women Married to Small Men,’ in my
next series of papers upon ‘Unconsidered Wrongs
of Our Sex.’ You see the reputation you are
earning for yourself with the powers that be!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Barton Ashe was a sensible man, well educated
and well bred. Under favoring circumstances, as
when inspired by the society of his wife and her
loving appreciation, he was quick with repartee
and apt at fence even with a wordy woman.
Under the present onslaught he was furious and
dumb. Had a man insulted him, and less grossly,
he would have knocked him down or given him his
card and demanded a meeting elsewhere. This berouged
and bedizened old maid compromised him
in the eyes of solid men and giddy girls by entering
into conversation with him at all. Each shrill
word was a prickle in a pore of his mental cuticle.
She advertised his wife as one of <i>her</i> kind,
arraigned him as despot and churl, menaced him
with public exposure, and posed as Agnes’
champion against the oppressor on whose side
was the power of law and tradition—made him
ridiculous to all within the sound of her brazen
tongue—and he was powerless.</p>

<p>He did the only thing possible to a man calling
himself a gentleman, when baited to desperation
in a public place by a woman who passes for a
lady—he lifted his hat silently and pulled the
strap to stop the car. Other passengers than Miss
Marvel marked the dark face and blazing eyes,
and curious regards wandered back to the offender,
smiling to herself at this new proof of her ability
to, in her favorite phrase, “drive a poisoned needle
under a man’s fifth rib.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Great Women Married To Small Men!</i>”</p>

<p>The most offensive count in the unanswered
indictment seemed to be flung after him by the
shrieking March wind. Until this moment of
intensest exasperation he had never consciously
compared himself mentally with his wife. That
spiritually she was purer and better he was ever
ready to admit. The gallant alacrity with which
men yield the palm of virtue and piety to women
may be due to the candor of real greatness, but a
keen student of human contrarieties is excusable
for likening it, sometimes, to the ostentatious
generosity of the child who surrenders to a playfellow
the wholesome “cookey,” while he holds
fast to the plum cake for his own delectation.</p>

<p>“Great” and “Small” were explicit terms that
threw our hero upon the hostile-defensive.
Agnes was a pearl among women, as good, true,
and sweet as any man need covet for a lifelong
companion. She kept his house well and his
home bright, her sympathies were ready, her
love was poured out upon him in unstinted measure,
she studied his tastes, humored his few
foibles, in brief, filled his life, or so much of it as
she could reach, most satisfactorily. Her mind
was fairly stocked with miscellaneous information;
she had remarkable facility in composition and
graceful fancies, and, above all, the happy knack
of saying, in a telling way, things people cared to
hear. Being in “the literary ring,” she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
secured a respectable audience, and, being a tactful
woman, she had kept it.</p>

<p>“Great,” she was not, in any sense of the word,
except according to the perverted standard of the
“Club” gang, the mutual-admiration circle, with
whom every poetaster was a Browning, and the
writer of turgid essays a Carlyle or Emerson.</p>

<p>He gave a scornful snort in repeating the
adjective. Agnes would be the first to deprecate
the application of it to herself. Yet—if she had
not invited the commendation of the <i>Précieuses
ridicules</i>—had her name never been bandied from
mouth to mouth in public, the antithetical
“small” had never been fitted to him. Husband
and wife were in false positions. That was clear—and
galling. Almost as clear, and harder to
endure, was his conviction that the situation could
not be altered for the better.</p>

<p>He had not made up his mind to graceful
acceptance of the inevitable when he fitted the
latchkey in the door of his own house.</p>

<p>The popular impression as to the housewifery
of pen-wrights had no confirmation within the
modest domicile of which Agnes Ashe was the
presiding genius. During her mother’s protracted
invalidism and her own betrothal she had
studied domestic economy, including cookery, with
the just regard to system and thoroughness that
made her successful in her other profession of
authorship. Her computations were correct and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
her methods dainty. She deserved the more
honor for all this because she was not naturally
fond of household occupations. If she reduced
dusting to a fine art, mixing and baking to an
exact science, it was conscientiously, not with
love for the duties themselves.</p>

<p>Once, when praised for excellent housekeeping
by a friend in her husband’s hearing, her native
sincerity made her say:</p>

<p>“You are mistaken in supposing that the
drudgery connected with home-making is easy
or pleasant to me. If I did not feel it my duty to
go into the kitchen sometimes, and to arrange
rooms, I doubt if I should ever do either. Nor
am I fond of sewing.”</p>

<p>“Yet your needle-work is exquisitely neat,”
said the surprised visitor.</p>

<p>“Because I hold myself to the necessity of
doing well what I undertake. It is all business,
not delight.”</p>

<p>After the visitor had gone, Barton gave a gentle
and needful caution.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk in that way to acquaintances,
dear,” he said. “I don’t want people to report
that your tastes are unfeminine.”</p>

<p>“Surely there are other feminine tastes besides
love for needle, broom, and egg-beater?” Agnes
protested, no less gently. “Why should every
woman be proficient in baking, when every man
is not compelled to learn book-keeping? I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
faithful in the discharge of domestic duties because
I love you and consider your happiness rather
than selfish ease. I love my home, and to enjoy
the effect of clean, orderly rooms and well-served
meals, I am willing to perform tasks for
which I have no real liking. The game is well
worth the candle—a good many waxlights, in
fact—but I question if you, for example, really
<i>like</i> to draw up conveyances and make searches.”</p>

<p>“Illustration is not argument,” said Barton
dryly. “You are undeniably a clever woman, my
love, but your reasoning would hardly convince a
jury. Women’s efforts in that direction are what
we style ‘special pleading.’”</p>

<p>This talk was held two months ago. Agnes
knew better, by now, than to attempt argument
with him, and his love grew apace because of the
forbearance he mistook for conviction of his
ability to direct thought with action. She was
the dearer for being dutiful. The docility with
which she listened to his dicta, never betraying a
suspicion that they were dogmas, won him to
forgetfulness of the circumstance that she was
his senior by six years and a blue-stocking.</p>

<p>She was in the front hall when he got home
to-night, receiving the adieu of a spectacled personage
whom she introduced as “Mr. Rowland
of Boston.”</p>

<p>“Charmed, I am sure,” said the stranger airily.
“The more that I am positive of enlisting Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Ashe’s powerful interest upon my side, and that
of the book-loving public. If Mrs. Ashe will pardon
the additional trespass upon her time, I
should like to explain to you, my dear sir, the
nature of my petition to her, and now to yourself.”</p>

<p>They returned to the parlor, and he had his
say. It was succinct and comprehensive. He
wished to engage Mrs. Ashe to write one of a
projected series of popular novels. Her coadjutors
would be authors of repute; the programme
was attractive and must take immensely
with the best class of readers. His terms were
liberal.</p>

<p>In any other mood than that for which Miss
Marvel was chiefly responsible, even a prejudiced
man must have been gratified by the compliment
to his wife implied in the application. It acted
upon the chafed surface of husbandly vanity and
dignity like moral <i>aqua fortis</i>. Barton listened
with lowering brow and compressed lips while the
fashionable publisher subjoined appeal to statement.
When both were concluded the master of
the house waited with palpable patience, apparently
to make sure that all the pleas were in, then
arose with the air of the long-bored householder
who dismisses a book agent.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ashe is so well acquainted with my views
upon the subject of her undertaking any literary
work whatsoever, that I may be allowed the
expression of my surprise at her reference of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
matter to me. I believe, however, that the
feminine <i>littérateur</i> considers a show of deference
to her husband a graceful form. Your appeal to
me is, you see, the idlest of courtesies. Now, as
I have just come home after a wearisome day of
business, may I ask you to excuse me from further
and fruitless consideration of this subject?”</p>

<p>He bowed and went off to his dressing room.</p>

<p>The man of the world, left thus awkwardly <i>en
tête-à-tête</i> with an insulted wife, always remembered
with grateful admiration the perfect breeding
that helped him out of the dilemma.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe is very tired and far from well,”
Agnes remarked, eye and smile cool and unembarrassed.
“As one conversant with the fatigues
and harassments of business life, you need no
apology beyond this for his seeming brusqueness.
I dare say—” with archness that was well
achieved—“that Mrs. Rowland would comprehend,
better than you, what serpentlike wisdom
we wives must exercise in broaching any subject
that requires thought to our hungry lords. I will
appeal from Philip famished to Philip full, in due
season, but I think you would better not depend
upon me. I am a very busy woman just now,
and shall be for some time to come.”</p>

<p>“It would give me solid satisfaction to punch
that fellow’s head,” muttered the publisher in the
street. “He is a boor and a tyrant, and his wife
is an angel.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>He was wrong in both specifications. Barton
Ashe was a vain man, and his vanity was smarting
from a recent attack. His ideas of the
supremacy, intellectual and official, that do hedge
a husband were overstrained, but natural.</p>

<p>Agnes Ashe was a very mortal woman, walking
up and down her pretty room after the departure
of her visitor, hands clenched until the
nails wounded the flesh, and cheeks so hot they
dried the tears before they fell. Her breath came
fast between the shut teeth. Women will comprehend
how much easier it was to forgive her
husband for the slur cast upon her than for lowering
himself in the eyes of a stranger.</p>

<p>“I am afraid of myself!” she whispered pantingly.
“I am afraid of <i>myself!</i> Must I, then,
despise him utterly? What right has he to charge
upon me as shame what others account as honor?
Can it be that he is conscious of being small and
fears to let me grow?”</p>

<p>By different roads, the refined woman, who
loved her art for its own sake and reverenced it
for the good it might do, and the pretender,
tolerated by true artists out of charity, and out of
respect for the active benevolence that redeemed
her from the rank of a public nuisance—had
arrived at a like conclusion.</p>

<p>Barton, after his bath and toilet, sat down to
dinner, and scarcely spoke until excellent clear
soup and the delicious creamed lobster prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
by Agnes’ own hands, had paved the way for more
substantial viands. Then his righteous wrath was
partially cooled by perception of the truth that
the still, pale woman opposite meant to enter no
defense against the aspersions cast upon her in
another’s hearing. Nay, more, she made no
attempt to cheat him into a milder mood,
broached no prudent topics, attempted no diversion.
Second thought found fresh fuel for displeasure
in her reticence. The double offense of
Miss Marvel’s tirade and the airy publisher’s
errand were not condonable by discreet silence.</p>

<p>He slashed simultaneously into a roast of beef
and the grievance upon his mind.</p>

<p>“I met your particular crony, Miss Marvel, in
the car on my way uptown. She was, if possible,
more detestably impertinent than usual.”</p>

<p>Agnes beckoned to the waitress and gave her
in a low tone an errand to the kitchen. Glancing
up at her husband, she saw that he had laid down
the carver and was gazing sternly at herself.</p>

<p>“May I, as the least important member of this
household, inquire why you sent that girl out of
the room? I may be, as your dear friends assert,
a small man married to a great woman, but I am
credited by others with a modicum of common
sense and discretion. I am willing to abide by
the consequences of whatever I say at my own
table and in the presence of my servants, if I
have any proprietorship in either.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Red heat he had never seen before in Agnes’
face suffused it now, her eyes dilated and
gleamed.</p>

<p>“I sent the girl from the room because she
was recommended to me by the matron of an
orphan asylum in which she was brought up.
Miss Marvel is a manager of the institution and
had the girl trained in a school for domestics.
Mary is much attached to her. I thought it
hardly safe or kind to discuss her in Mary’s
presence.”</p>

<p>Barton met generous heat with deadly coldness.</p>

<p>“When is your waitress’ month up?”</p>

<p>“On the fifteenth.”</p>

<p>“This is the seventh. Pay her a week’s wages
to-morrow and pack her off. I will have none of
that woman’s spies in my house—that is, always
supposing it to be mine. I understand this afternoon’s
scene. She is kept posted as to the status
of domestic affairs.”</p>

<p>“You are out of humor, Barton, or you could
not be so unjust to me and to a faithful servant.”</p>

<p>Griselda would not have retorted in a hard,
cutting tone, but Griselda could neither read nor
write. Diffusion of knowledge has a tendency to
breed sedition among the lower orders.</p>

<p>Clubs for the lofty, and lager beer saloons for
the lowly, stand, with controversial Benedicks, for
the “refuges” foreign cities offer to the fugitive
from wheels and hoofs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Excuse me for leaving you to digest your
dinner and the memory of that last remark in
solitude,” Barton said sardonically. “I shall
finish <i>my</i> dinner at the club.”</p>

<p>The library was the coziest room in the house.
Before Mr. Rowland called, Agnes had looked
into it to see that the fire was bright and that Barton’s
easy-chair, newspaper, and cigar-stand were
in place. Upon the table was a bowl of <i>Bon
Silène</i> roses he had ordered on his way downtown
that morning. She had poured out his
coffee and lighted his cigar here for him last
night. It all rushed over her with the pure deliciousness
of the roses’ breath, as she returned to
the deserted apartment after dinner. As she
moved, the fragrance broke into waves that overwhelmed
her with the sweet agony of associativeness.</p>

<p>Sinking upon her knees before her husband’s
chair, she laid her head within her enfolding arms
and remained thus until the clock struck nine.
Then she spoke aloud:</p>

<p>“What has he given me in exchange for my
beautiful ideal world and for my work? A
drugged cup, with gall and wormwood in the
bottom.”</p>

<p>The slow, scornful syllables jarred the perfumed
waves and echoed hollowly in the still
corners.</p>

<p>She arose, unlocked a secretary at the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the room, and took out a worn portfolio—also
locked. Selecting from the contents several large
sheets of paper, she laid them in order upon the
table, and drew from an inner pocket a gold pen
in a shabby handle. With it she had written her
first book. For six years she had used no other.
Before dipping it into the ink, she kissed it.</p>

<p>“I have come back to you!” she said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the first heavy snows of December a
little daughter was given to Agnes Ashe.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Day her husband proposed to
read aloud to her a book “some of the Club fellows
were talking about last night.” The pale
face flushed nervously when he undid the wrapping
paper.</p>

<p>It was one of the “happenings” we persist in
classing among singular coincidences, although
they are of daily occurrence, that he should have
selected that particular novel for their entertainment
on the holiday he proposed to devote
entirely to his convalescent wife.</p>

<p>“The Story of Walter King” had not been
sent, as one might suppose would have been
natural, to Mr. Rowland of Boston.</p>

<p>“He would guess instantly how matters are,”
Agnes reasoned. “I am still too proud to run
that risk.”</p>

<p>She took the MS. instead to a New York
publisher in whose discretion she could trust, told
him of her whim to establish a new reputation
which should owe nothing to past gains, and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the story with him. In a week it was accepted
and in the printer’s hands. When Baby Agnes—upon
whom the mother bestowed the Scotch pet-name
of “Nest”—was born, new editions were
selling as fast as the press could turn them
out.</p>

<p>It was evident, said critics, that the fresh, nervous
novel was from the hand of a young writer,
skilled in the use of language but unhackneyed
by the need of furnishing “pot-boilers.” It was as
evident, said readers, that the unknown author
had fed the pen directly from his heart, and that
personal experience had had much to do with the
make-up of the “live book.”</p>

<p>Agnes had held no communication with the
discreet publisher since the contract was signed.
She had not corrected the proof-sheets, or had an
advance copy of the work. There was, therefore,
literal truth in her reply to Barton’s query—“Have
you read it?”</p>

<p>“I have not even seen the book that I recollect.
Who is the author?”</p>

<p>“John C. Hart”—turning to the title page.
“What else has he done?”</p>

<p>“The name sounds familiar. Or, perhaps it
may be that I am thinking of Professor John S.
Hart. You are very kind to think of getting a
new book for me! trebly kind to offer to read it
to me.”</p>

<p>“It is little enough I can do for the best wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in Christendom!” stooping to kiss her and then
Baby Nest asleep in her crib beside Agnes’ reclining
chair.</p>

<p>The languid mother, grateful for his society
and loverly attentions, was more like his ideal
wife than Agnes had been since the eve of her
birthday, when he had almost forgotten (through
her fault) that he was a gentleman. No explanations
had followed the ugly scene. They had
met at breakfast the next morning as if the fracas
had not occurred, but then and thereafter he had
missed something from his married life. Had he
tried to analyze the vague, ever present discomfort,
he would have said that his wife was always on
guard. No surprise of abrupt or rough speech
betrayed her into a show of temper or wounded
feeling. No overflow of tenderness elicited a
confession of answering devotion. When questioned,
she was frank in declaring that she loved
him, and sought to make him happy in his home
and content with her. She was never sad in his
sight. Domestic and society duties were cheerfully
performed, she was always ready to go out
with him when he desired it and gave him her
company at home conscientiously. There was
the sore spot! He could not prove that her love
and duty were perfunctory, but he never got
away from the irritating suspicion that they were.
Had she been miserable, pettish, or fretfully exacting,
it would have accorded better with his creed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the absolute dependence of a woman upon her
lord. In plain English—which, however, he
would have been ashamed to put into words
in any language—it irked him that his mental
and moral barometer could not set the weather
for his household. There was a <i>something</i> back
of Agnes’ even temper and equable spirits he
could not touch and that told him she was sufficient
unto herself. Into this she seemed to retire
as into the cleft of a rock when the matrimonial
horizon threatened storm.</p>

<p>There was no one to tell him of mornings
spent in the library, or of the work done during
the evenings he passed at the club. He ought to
have been gratified at her smiling aquiescence
in his apologetic representation of the business
necessity laid upon a man to mingle socially with
“the fellows.” Some women made it preciously
disagreeable for husbands who acted upon this
compulsion, but his wife was never lonely by day
or night. If he came home at eleven o’clock,
she was in the library, reading or knitting beside
a glowing fire, ready to receive him and to listen
with interest to club stories or incidents. If he
stayed out after midnight, she went to bed like a
sensible Christian and slept soundly.</p>

<p>What could be more exemplary and satisfactory?
He had a model wife. Would sulks,
tears, and chidings have been more to his taste?
This conclusion reached, he would berate himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for “an unreasonable dog”—and go on missing
something he could not define.</p>

<p>An odd conceit came to Agnes as the full,
manly voice began “The Story of Walter King”—a
fancy that won a smile from her at first, and
terrified her when she could not shake it off. She
was the unsuspected mother of a foundling. In
secret and in fear, she had laid the new-born baby
at a stranger’s door. He had cared for, fostered,
and clothed it, and on this New Year’s Day, her
husband had ignorantly adopted the waif and led
it, a beautiful child, to her, bespeaking her admiration
for it.</p>

<p>For her own baby! the thing born of her soul,
the express image of her thought, the bright,
glorious darling in whom, and with whom, and
by whom, she had lived all these weary, weary
months! Her husband would introduce these two
to one another! Was her left hand a stranger to
her right? Was her heart alien to the blood leaping
from it?</p>

<p>She could have laughed and cried hysterically,
could have snatched the book from the unconscious
reader and covered it with tears and kisses.
She must touch and hold it once, if but for a
minute, or the strained heart-strings would part.</p>

<p>“Can you see well?” she interrupted the reader
to ask. The calm tone surprised herself and lent
her courage to carry out her stratagem. “Does
the light fall right for you? In her anxiety to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
exclude draughts and the snow glare, Mrs. Ames
may have made it too dark for well people. Is
the type pretty clear?”</p>

<p>She put out her hand and drew the volume from
his. The sight of familiar paragraphs and names
was as if the child had laughed, in happy recognition,
into her eyes. She passed her fingers lovingly
over the page, stroked the binding, raised
the open book to her lips, and gave it back
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“The smell of newly printed pages is delicious
to me,” she said, trying to laugh. “Sweeter than
new-mown hay.”</p>

<p>“They have brought it out in good style,” observed
Barton carelessly. “One gets no slipshod
literature from that house. Their imprint is a title
of intellectual nobility.”</p>

<p>Agnes smiled brightly in assent, turned her
cheek to the cushioned back of her chair, and
closed her eyes to keep the happy tears from slipping
beneath the lids. Was the time close at
hand in which she could safely acknowledge her
offspring? To screen the fact of her maternity
from possible premature discovery she had refrained
from so much as looking upon or speaking
of the bantling for these long weeks. Providence
had put this opportunity of honorable recognition
before her. How should she seize it?</p>

<p>A thought struck her like an icebolt. What
would Barton say, even in this auspicious hour, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the systematic concealment practiced before and
since the advent of the adopted child? Would
he throw it from him as he would a snake? She
pictured the possibility of virtuous horror in the
regards turned upon her, the aversion a moral
man feels for a lost woman. Deception—even
untruth might be forgiven; the deliberate disregard
of his expressed wish that his wife should
never again put sentiment or feeling of hers into
print would be construed into absolute crime.
He held the desire for literary renown on the part
of a woman to be a fault that unsexed her. In a
young girl the ambition might spring from the
unrest of an unfilled heart, mistaken, but pardonable
as a blunder of ignorance. A wife’s heart,
thoughts, and hands should be <i>full</i> of home and
home loves, or she did not deserve her high and
blessed estate.</p>

<p>She felt, now, that she could never make him
understand how the side of her nature which he
saw and knew was bettered and elevated by the
healthful action of its twin, to which he was a
stranger. She <i>had</i> “put herself into the book,”
but not in the lower and vulgar sense in which the
reviewers had used the phrase. The aspirations
with which others could not intermeddle—least of
all, the husband who so grossly misjudged her, the
fancies that beguiled Time of heaviness and drew
the soreness from her heart while she dallied with
them—were there. Her ideals were her real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
companions; her dream children her only confidants.</p>

<p>“<i>The things which are seen are temporal; the
things which are not seen are eternal.</i>”</p>

<p>The author who is not made, but born; the
idealist whose brain creations are to him almost
visible and tangible, while he communes with
them—can, of all men, enter most joyfully into
the meaning of the sweet mysticism uttered by
the Creator of things temporal and things
eternal.</p>

<p>It was a snowy day; transient glimmers of
white light, shed from thinner clouds, were the
precursors of thicker falls of soundless flakes.
There was no wind, and as Agnes watched the
storm between the slightly parted blinds, a curtain
of purest lace seemed unfolding and wavering
earthward. The hush of a great holiday enwrapped
the city. Baby Nest slumbered peacefully
amid billows of lawn and wool; the strong,
mobile features of the husband she loved and
feared more than any other living mortal darkened
and lightened like the snow clouds, with the
progress of the story. He read well, and threw
unusual spirit into the present task.</p>

<p>Agnes hearkened, with a growing sense of unreality.
The disowned child pressed nearer and
closer, gazed appealingly into her face, cooed
love words in her ear, covered with kisses the
hands with which the hapless mother was constrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to hold it aloof from the heart that
yearned to take it in.</p>

<p>Sometimes Barton’s voice sounded a great way
off, and she confused his utterances with the
winged ideas she had formulated into human language.
Was she thinking it all out? or was <i>he</i>
enunciating what she <i>had</i> thought through the
languorous summer days and cool autumn evenings?
She used to wonder, amusedly, what he
supposed she did during the many hours she
spent in solitude. He never asked, but if he had
deemed the matter worthy of speculation, he
might have reasoned that a woman who did not
make her own clothes and had no taste for fancy
work, whose house was well appointed and not
large, and whose health was good must, with two
servants to do housework and cooking, have much
time upon her hands.</p>

<p>“How do women occupy themselves who keep
plenty of servants and do not write, paint, or
study anything in particular?” asked the young
son of a woman who kept house, wrote
books, painted pictures, and studied with her
children.</p>

<p>“They make a profession of <i>horacide!</i>” answered
the mother.</p>

<p>Barton lowered the book so abruptly that his
wife started and clasped her hands involuntarily.
She was very weak.</p>

<p>“I should like to know this man!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“What man?”</p>

<p>“The fellow who wrote this book! He is a
New York lawyer—that is plain. His insight of
legal chicanery and his apt use of technical law
terms show that, if his clever reasoning did not.
A Columbia graduate, too! I’ll go bail for that.
And a society man. By George! that narrows
the case down pretty well. I don’t know a man
at the city bar, though, who has sufficient literary
skill to turn out such a piece of work as this.
‘John C. Hart’ is a pseudonym, of course—but
there may be a meaning in it.”</p>

<p>He fell into a muse over the title page, knotting
his brows and plucking at his lower lip
while he scanned the name.</p>

<p>Agnes’ breath came quick; her head swam as
in seasickness. She shook herself mentally and
tried to speak as usual:</p>

<p>“It may be another case of George Eliot,
<i>alias</i> Mary Anne Evans; or Charles Egbert Craddock,
<i>alias</i> Miss Murfree.”</p>

<p>“Preposterous! There isn’t a feminine touch
in the book. And no woman of the education
and refinement of this writer could know anything
of the scenes and motives he describes.
Men can paint women faithfully. Women who
try to depict men show us up as hybrids, creatures
of their own sex disguised in masculine
habiliments. Ready-made clothes at that, baggy
at the knees and short at the wrists. I should <i>not</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
like, however, to know a woman who could write
‘The Story of Walter King.’”</p>

<p>“It does not impress me as coarse!” Agnes was
nerved by instinctive resentment to say.</p>

<p>“Not a symptom of coarseness about it. But
it <i>is</i> virile—and that your woman author ought
never to be! Any man might be proud of having
written this novel. Any true, modest woman
would blush to be accused of it. You see the
difference?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> see the difference between the patient I left
three hours ago, and the one I find here now!”
interjected the nurse bluntly.</p>

<p>She had come in while Barton was speaking,
and had her hand on Mrs. Ashe’s pulse.</p>

<p>“Tut! tut! tut!” she went on in grave vexation.
“We shall have the doctor again if this
sort of excitement goes on. Eyes glassy, pulse
up, and, I venture to say, headache back of the
eyes. Don’t deny it, Mrs. Ashe! I know the
signs. Here’s your lunch—after which, we <i>must</i>
have the room darkened and try to compose
your nerves. It won’t do to have a throw-back
at this late day.”</p>

<p>Barton carried off “The Story of Walter King”
with him to the library, a little anxious, but more
aggrieved. In common with the mighty majority
of husbands, he resented Mrs. Gamp the more
virulently because impotent against her tyranny.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven that her time, like her infernal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
master’s, is short!” growled he, dropping into his
easy-chair and throwing his legs over the foot-rest
in lordly disdain of appearances. “I suppose
women enjoy being hectored, or the sex would
rise <i>en masse</i> against this order of haggish humbugs.
Agnes didn’t dare peep a defense of herself,
or of me. Great Scott! suppose I had been
born a woman!”</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar and reopened his book. A
luxurious, if lonely, lunch was served at half-past
one. Wine and walnuts went with him into the
library after the meal was eaten. The air was blue
with fragrant smoke for the rest of the day. He
did not take the nap he had promised himself as
the chief delight of a lazy afternoon, until the
last page of “The Story of Walter King” was
devoured. Even after he had stretched himself
upon the lounge and drawn the silken and eiderdown
slumber-robe over him, he lay looking at
the purring fire of sea-coal and listening to the
muffled tinkle of sleigh-bells along Fifth Avenue,
which was but a block distant—and thinking of
the book that had enchained him so many hours.
It had taken a powerful grip of his imagination
and titillated his intellectual palate smartly.
There were passages in it that recalled pertinent
and pregnant sayings of his own relative to certain
topics discussed in the fascinating pages;
theories he had advanced and maintained; his
very turns of speech were here and there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Again he said, “I should like to know that
man. He has a long head and sharp wits of his
own. Immense knowledge of the world and
human nature.” Without the least intention of
being conceited he subjoined to the silent soliloquy:
“If I had turned my attention to literature,
I believe I could have written that book. But
one man cannot be proficient in everything. The
suggestion of feminine authorship is ridiculous.
Poor Agnes is a sensible girl, but she is wide of
the mark there.”</p>

<p>Here his thoughts wandered into the poppied
plains of sleep.</p>

<p>Awaking from his siesta to find himself in the
dark, he arose refreshed, and paid a dutiful call to
his wife’s chamber before going out to dine at his
club. The nurse met him upon the threshold
and stepped out into the hall for a whispered colloquy.
Both of her charges had been restless all
the afternoon. The baby was colicky, Mrs. Ashe
feverish and excited, although persisting that
nothing ailed her.</p>

<p>“She has an exquisitely susceptible nervous
organization,” she continued in the parrotlike
lingo of the trained nurse. “We must really
guard her more carefully in future. She was talking
about that novel in her sleep just now—begging
you not to take it away from her and all
that, in quite a wild way. There is evidently
cerebral excitement. Perhaps, as you are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
out, it might be prudent to telephone the doctor
to drop in toward bedtime.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a good sleep will set her up all right!”
returned Barton slightingly. It did not suit his
notions of marital rights to be interviewed and
advised in a ghostly whisper without the precincts
of his own room, by this pretentious hireling.
“The book had nothing to do with her uncomfortable
afternoon. It was probably the luncheon.
I thought, when you brought it up, that it was
more like a meal for a ditcher than for a delicate
invalid.”</p>

<p>Pleased at administering this Roland for accumulated
Olivers, he ran downstairs without attending
to her protest, and whistled softly while
equipping himself for the walk through the snow.
The night was sharply cold; the drifts were as
dry as dust. He laughed like a boy in plowing
through them. The return to bachelor freedom
was not bad, for a change, and there were sure to
be a lot of prime fellows at the club on a stormy
holiday night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> eleven o’clock of that New Year’s night the
snow still fell, but the wind had increased to a
gale, and shook the eastward windows of Agnes
Ashe’s bedchamber.</p>

<p>Nurse and baby were sound asleep in the adjoining
nursery. Even in the well-built house and
curtained room, the night-light wavered in the
unquiet air, sending fitful hosts of specter shadows
scurrying over the ceiling and falling down
the walls. Sometimes one dropped upon the bed
and made mouths or crooked lean fingers at the
convalescent. Now and then they whispered
something in fleeing or skulking past. When this
happened they spoke of her husband and how he
had carried off both her babies downstairs. For
Baby Nest’s crib was gone. She had been doubly
robbed.</p>

<p>The door of communication between the rooms
was ajar. Mrs. Ashe had need to move cautiously
in arising and wrapping herself in a dressing
gown. She had been three weeks upstairs.
Mrs. Ames had declared her too feeble to walk
across the room unaided, but to-night she felt
strong and restless. Her brain was teeming with
fledged thoughts, crying and fluttering to escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
If she had pen and ink she could begin another
book, now that the nurse was asleep and Barton
out. But that was not her reason for getting up
and slipping on the wrapper. Oh, no! She drew
the door to behind her cautiously, listened with
held breath for sounds from the inner room, and
hearing nothing, smiled cunningly, crept to the
stair-head and down the polished steps. Their
chill struck through the slippers into which she
had thrust her stockingless feet; she shivered in
the wind that drove fine snow under the front
door and whistled jeeringly at her as she went by.</p>

<p>The library was void of human presence but
warm and murky red with firelight. The vivid
glow of the Argand burner, as she touched the
regulator, shone upon glittering eyes, scarlet
cheeks, and red lips that showed her teeth in the
fixed smile of successful cunning. She found
what she sought at once. Barton had left “The
Story of Walter King” upon the table beside his
reading chair. He would be out late. There was
nothing to call him home and he was fond of his
club. She was quite safe for an hour or two—secure
from spy and intrusion—she and her brain-baby.</p>

<p>Clasping it to her heart, she wept and smiled,
rocked herself to and fro as she would cuddle
Baby Nest, did the nurse allow it. There was
nobody to meddle with her here. She settled
herself in the easy-chair and, finding where Barton
had left off, read on and on, until the type began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to gyrate queerly in fantastic measure across the
page. Her eyes were getting tired. The tyrant
above-stairs had prohibited reading so long that
the effort tried her strength.</p>

<p>Still holding the book to her bosom, she looked
around. The library was not so orderly as when
she visited it tri-daily. There were no flowers on
the table, yet she fancied that she smelled <i>Bon
Silène</i> roses, as she had on that far-back March
night when she unlocked the door leading into
her beautiful, comforting Other World, where no
rough blasts shook buds from blowing, no iron
hand pressed down Fancy and held in Imagination
with curb and bridle. The ash-cup of the
bronze smoking table was filled with ashes, burnt
stumps of cigars littered the hearth. Seeing them
she bethought herself of the truncated brown
canoe tossing in the foam-fringe of the tide on
the Old Point beach. By shutting her eyes she
could reproduce the scene with the minuteness of
a photograph; could see the floating and swooping
gulls, silver-breasted against the blue sky, and
hear the swash of the waters between the rocks.</p>

<p>She was dreaming! It would never do to fall
asleep here and be discovered by Barton or Mrs.
Ames! Rubbing her eyes, she forced herself to
note that one slipper lay on the rug, the other
under a chair, just as Barton had kicked it off.</p>

<p>“Fie! fie! what would people say of a literary
woman’s <i>menage</i>, were these things seen?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently, when her head stopped reeling, she
would pick them up and straighten the slumber-robe,
all crumpled together on the foot of the
lounge, the pillow of which was indented by Barton’s
head. Sitting bolt upright, she stared at
robe and cushion, so eloquent of her husband’s
recent presence. Her eyes were dry with misery,
her features worked into sharpness. She looked,
not six, but twenty years older than the hale man
who had lain there, indolent and at ease, while she
turned wretchedly upon her bed throughout the
tedious afternoon.</p>

<p>Oh, the dead Past! Oh, murdered Love!</p>

<p>“He said that no pure woman would have
written that book,” she murmured. “He must
never know! Why, he would turn me into the
street to-night, if he found it out.”</p>

<p>She crossed the room, catching at the furniture
as she staggered along to the secretary. The key
hung upon a hidden hook under the drawers.
She felt for it, opened the central compartment of
the escritoire, and took out an old, roomy portfolio.
There were papers in it that must be
destroyed. She meant to do it before she was
taken ill, but everything had been so sudden. It
would never do to leave them for other eyes in
case of her death. While she fumbled in the
pockets and drew out the MSS. she checked herself
in repeating irrelevant rhymes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“That husbands could be cruel,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I have known for seasons three,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But, oh! to ride Vindictive while a baby cries for me.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“If only my head would be steady and clear
again for five minutes!”</p>

<p>The portfolio was nearly emptied into her lap
when an awful voice from the doorway said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ashe! what am I to think of this extraordinary
proceeding?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ames, portentous in flannel gown and
curl-papers, confronted the affrighted culprit.
Through the open door and down the stairway
came the wail of the hungry baby.</p>

<p>“I only came down for her brother,” tremblingly
clutching her book, and letting the portfolio
slide to the floor. “I felt so strong! so
well! I will run up to the little sister now—at
once. Poor little Nest! she wants me, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gamp’s severe eyes softened into anxiety.
She spoke soothingly, in passing her powerful
arm around the shaking form.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear. She wants mamma. Lean on me
and don’t hurry too much. The stairs are a steep
climb.”</p>

<p>Upon the upper landing Agnes, stopping to
breathe, smiled piteously into the compassionate
face.</p>

<p>“You see”—showing a corner of the volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
hidden in the folds of her gown—“this is as
much my baby as the other one, and I knew he
was downstairs all alone. You will let me keep
him—won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, dear! We’ll put him to bed with
you, right under your pillow.”</p>

<p>“And not a word to Barton?” Putting her
lips close to the other’s ear, she whispered fearfully—“You
know he would turn us both out into
the street if he knew.”</p>

<p>“He shan’t hear a lisp from me!” asseverated
the nurse stoutly. “We’ll have the two of you
sound asleep before he comes in.”</p>

<p>She always humored delirious patients. In
such cases veracity courtesied to expediency.</p>

<p>The prime fellows made up a theater party after
the club dinner and ended a jolly day with a
jollier supper. The silvery tongue of the French
timepiece upon the library mantel said it was one
o’clock as Barton, entering, was amazed to see
that he must have left the Argand reading burner
up at full height. A second step showed traces of
other occupation than his and of later date. His
wife’s secretary was open, a portfolio lay wide
upon the floor, and the rug was strewed with
papers. Before the suspicion of burglary could
cross his mind, he trod upon something hard. It
was a heavy gold hair pin of a peculiar pattern,
which Agnes wore constantly. He had noticed it
in her hair at noon to-day, as her head lay back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
against the cushions, weighed down, it would seem,
by the heavy coils.</p>

<p>Had that hypocritical hag of a nurse allowed
such outrageous imprudence in his absence? He
examined the lock of the secretary. The key
which he believed was kept upstairs by Agnes
was in it; a survey of the apartment revealed no
other signs of unwonted disorder.</p>

<p>“Oh, these women!” his face, florid with champagne,
hock, and righteous choler, crimsoned
apoplectically when he stooped for the portfolio.
A sheet of paper, covered with his wife’s neat,
compact chirography, fell out.</p>

<p>It was in verse, and bore no caption.</p>

<p>“So-ho! poetry!”</p>

<p>As in a dream, he seemed to hear Agnes’
voice:</p>

<p>“I am not a bard at all. When I am in the
dark, or at best in a half-light—sorry or weary,
or lonely of heart—my thoughts take rhythmic
shape.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of the third page of the rhymes
was a date.</p>

<p>“<i>October 5, 188—.</i>”</p>

<p>He recollected the day. He had gone off to
join some friends for a week’s hunting, leaving
her in a quiet mountain inn.</p>

<p>“And she was lonely of heart—poor little
wifie!”</p>

<p>He sat down to read:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The champagne had been heady, and there was
a good deal of hock. Tears of maudlin sentimentality
suffused the reader’s eyes at the metrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
tribute to himself as his wife’s “hero-saint.” So
long as she published nothing of the sort, it was
pleasant to find, accidentally, that she wrote love
verses in his absence, dedicated to him. He had
not suspected how much she felt their parting—she
had borne herself so heroically. Brushing
away the soft moisture, he read on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>He went over the second section of the poem
twice before the wine-warmed brain accepted the
significance of the lines.</p>

<p>Then, he swore a little. He would be no-matter-what-ed
if he could make out women’s
fantasies. He supposed this was a fancy sketch,
an impersonal rigmarole, altogether, but it was
no-matter-what-ed (again) disagreeable stuff for a
fellow to read who recollected that he had ridden
away last October from a dry-eyed wife into the
burning heart of such a wood as was here described.
He did not remember turning under
the maple tree, it was true—if indeed there were
a maple tree at the top of the hill. There might
be some mistake in the whole thing, but it went
against a fellow’s grain to admit the possibility
that his wife had another man even in the eye of
her imagination.</p>

<p>He renewed the business of collecting the scattered
papers. He would read no more poetry
to-night, but an unsealed law envelope, without
address, lay under the armchair. It was white
and fresh, and the folds of the instrument inclosed
were crisp with newness. He pulled it out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Memorandum of Agreement</span> made this 6th
Day of August, 188—, between <span class="smcap">Agnes Welles
Ashe</span> of New York City, and <span class="smcap">Rhine, Rhone &amp;
Co.</span>, Publishers of New York City.</p>

<p>“Said <span class="smcap">Agnes Welles Ashe</span> being the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and proprietor of a work entitled, ‘<span class="smcap">The Story
of Walter King, By John C. Hart</span>,’ in consideration
of the covenants and stipulation, etc.,
etc., etc.”</p></div>

<p>The shock cleared the lawyer’s head on the
instant. He perused the document to signatures,
seals, and witnesses, refolded and restored it to
the envelope, put it back into the portfolio, and
the portfolio into the escritoire, turned the key
in the lock and took his stand upon the rug, his
hands behind his back, his back to the fire. His
face was purple, his eyes glared.</p>

<p>“So much for marrying a literary woman!
They are a <i>bad</i> lot!”</p>

<p>He spat it out viciously and a bitter, sounding
oath after it.</p>

<p>The door-bell rang loudly, attended by the
sound of stamping feet upon the mat outside.
The master of the house answered the summons.
The family physician crowded in past him, pulling
off his overcoat as he came.</p>

<p>“How is she?” he demanded, without preamble.</p>

<p>“She! Who?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ashe! One of your maids telephoned
for me at half-past twelve, from the nearest
station—‘Come at once! Mrs. Ashe is dangerously
ill.’ Can there be some mistake?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ames called him from the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
stairs: “Come up quick, please, doctor. It takes
two of us to hold her in bed.”</p>

<p>The doctor rushed upstairs. Barton walked
leisurely back into the library and shut the door.
A woman who had sat here reading old MSS. and
new contracts until she heard her husband’s latchkey
in the outer door, then rushed off up a long
flight of stairs to avoid him, in such frantic haste
that she fell into a fit at the top, might come out
of it without his help. He would never be fooled
by her again, so help him God!</p>

<p>Half an hour went by and he had not moved,
although the stealthy rush of feet overhead
bespoke excitement and yet caution on the part
of the attendants, and twice a faint scream penetrated
the ceiling. At last he reached out his
hand for pen and paper and began a letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

“<span class="smcap">My Dear Uncle</span>:

<p>“I said to you, jestingly, thirteen months ago,
that I would employ you to draw up articles of
separation in the event of my needing——”</p></div>

<p>The pen stopped. He could have sworn that
someone passed him, so close that he felt the
wind from floating garments, and that there was
the odor of <i>Bon Silène</i> roses in the air. It was
strangely still overhead. Cold sweat broke out
all over him; when he strove to resume his writing,
his fingers were nerveless. Slow, heavy feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
came down the stairs and to the library door. It
was opened without the ceremony of knocking,
and the physician appeared.</p>

<p>A withering glance took in the details of the
quiet figure at the table, the paper, and the pen
arrested in the hand. He went through no form
of merciful preparation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ashe! your wife is dead! A severe
shock of some kind—the nurse thinks you can
explain it—brought on convulsions and suffusion
of the brain.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Baby Nest survived her mother but a week.
Her father married again, eighteen months afterward,
a beautiful society girl with a tolerable
fortune.</p>

<p>She said a good thing in my hearing the other
night, which I offer here in the place of the conventional
moral, my story having none.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing with yourself all
the winter?” she asked of a fine-featured, dainty
little old lady, whose blue blood adds nameless
finish to the fair product of brains and breeding.
“I have not seen you for an age.”</p>

<p>“I have gone out to few large assemblies this
season,” said Queen Mab. “But I have greatly
enjoyed certain conclaves of choice spirits, to
which I have been admitted. Evenings with the
Laurence Huttons, the Edmund Clarence Stedmans,
the Brander Matthewses, and Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
William Dean Howells are something to be remembered
forever with pride and delight.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es?” the priceless lace on bust and sleeves
swaying in the languid breeze of her fan. “I
have heard others say that <i>some of these Bohemians</i>
are really very, very nice—don’t you

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
